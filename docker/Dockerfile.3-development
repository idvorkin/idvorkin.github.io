# Add any development tools or experimental features here
# Examples:
# - Additional language servers for neovim
# - Extra debugging tools
# - Development databases
# - Additional programming language runtimes

# This allows Claude to run without permission checks in the container

# Simple approach: just ensure directories exist for mounting
# Auth will be mounted directly from host
