Developing you strengths is 3 times as effective as improving your weakness, so find your strengths and double down. To bootstrap the discovery of my strengths, I used a tool called StrengthFinder and it discovered my strengths are Activator, Communication, Problem Solving (Resolver in StrengthFinder speak) Adaptability, and Ideation.

_You can take strength finder test yourself [here](https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/) by buying the Strength Finder 2.0 book, which comes with a code for taking the Strength Finder online assessment._

### The short version of my strengths

**Activator** - People who are especially talented in the Activator theme can
make things happen by turning thoughts into action. They are
often impatient.

**Communication** - People who are especially talented in the Communication
theme generally find it easy to put their thoughts into words.
They are good conversationalists and presenters.

**Restorative** - People who are especially talented in the Restorative theme are
adept at dealing with problems. They are good at figuring out
what is wrong and resolving it.

**Adaptability** - People who are especially talented in the Adaptability theme
prefer to "go with the flow." They tend to be "now" people who
take things as they come and discover the future one day at a
time.

**Ideation** - People who are especially talented in the Ideation theme are
fascinated by ideas. They are able to find connections between
seemingly disparate phenomena.

### The long version of my strengths

**Activator** - "When can we start?" This is a recurring question in your life. You are impatient for action. You may
concede that analysis has its uses or that debate and discussion can occasionally yield some
valuable insights, but deep down you know that only action is real. Only action can make things
happen. Only action leads to performance. Once a decision is made, you cannot not act. Others may
worry that "there are still some things we don't know," but this doesn't seem to slow you. If the
decision has been made to go across town, you know that the fastest way to get there is to go
stoplight to stoplight. You are not going to sit around waiting until all the lights have turned green.
Besides, in your view, action and thinking are not opposites. In fact, guided by your Activator theme,
you believe that action is the best device for learning. You make a decision, you take action, you look
at the result, and you learn. This learning informs your next action and your next. How can you grow if
you have nothing to react to? Well, you believe you can't. You must put yourself out there. You must
take the next step. It is the only way to keep your thinking fresh and informed. The bottom line is this:
You know you will be judged not by what you say, not by what you think, but by what you get done.
This does not frighten you. It pleases you.

**Communication** - You like to explain, to describe, to host, to speak in public, and to write. This is your Communication
theme at work. Ideas are a dry beginning. Events are static. You feel a need to bring them to life, to
energize them, to make them exciting and vivid. And so you turn events into stories and practice
telling them. You take the dry idea and enliven it with images and examples and metaphors. You
believe that most people have a very short attention span. They are bombarded by information, but
very little of it survives. You want your information-whether an idea, an event, a product's features
and benefits, a discovery, or a lesson-to survive. You want to divert their attention toward you and
then capture it, lock it in. This is what drives your hunt for the perfect phrase. This is what draws you
toward dramatic words and powerful word combinations. This is why people like to listen to you. Your
word pictures pique their interest, sharpen their world, and inspire them to act.

**Restorative** - You love to solve problems. Whereas some are dismayed when they encounter yet another
breakdown, you can be energized by it. You enjoy the challenge of analyzing the symptoms,
identifying what is wrong, and finding the solution. You may prefer practical problems or conceptual
ones or personal ones. You may seek out specific kinds of problems that you have met many times
before and that you are confident you can fix. Or you may feel the greatest push when faced with
complex and unfamiliar problems. Your exact preferences are determined by your other themes and
experiences. But what is certain is that you enjoy bringing things back to life. It is a wonderful feeling
to identify the undermining factor(s), eradicate them, and restore something to its true glory.
Intuitively, you know that without your intervention, this thing-this machine, this technique, this
person, this company-might have ceased to function. You fixed it, resuscitated it, rekindled its
vitality. Phrasing it the way you might, you saved it.

**Adaptability** - You live in the moment. You don't see the future as a fixed destination. Instead, you see it as a place
that you create out of the choices that you make right now. And so you discover your future one
choice at a time. This doesn't mean that you don't have plans. You probably do. But this theme of
Adaptability does enable you to respond willingly to the demands of the moment even if they pull you
away from your plans. Unlike some, you don't resent sudden requests or unforeseen detours. You
expect them. They are inevitable. Indeed, on some level you actually look forward to them. You are, at
heart, a very flexible person who can stay productive when the demands of work are pulling you in
many different directions at once.

**Ideation** - You are fascinated by ideas. What is an idea? An idea is a concept, the best explanation of the most
events. You are delighted when you discover beneath the complex surface an elegantly simple
concept to explain why things are the way they are. An idea is a connection. Yours is the kind of mind
that is always looking for connections, and so you are intrigued when seemingly disparate
phenomena can be linked by an obscure connection. An idea is a new perspective on familiar
challenges. You revel in taking the world we all know and turning it around so we can view it from a
strange but strangely enlightening angle. You love all these ideas because they are profound,
because they are novel, because they are clarifying, because they are contrary, because they are
bizarre. For all these reasons you derive a jolt of energy whenever a new idea occurs to you. Others
may label you creative or original or conceptual or even smart. Perhaps you are all of these. Who can
be sure? What you are sure of is that ideas are thrilling. And on most days this is enough.

### Bonus: My PANAS Personality Type

I'm a **Mad Scientist** - high on both positive and negative affect. This means I experience emotions intensely across the full spectrum. When I'm up, I'm REALLY up. When I'm down, I'm REALLY down. It's both a superpower and a challenge. The creativity and passion are amazing, but I need to actively manage the emotional rollercoaster.

### Bonus: My Enneagram (Any-O-Gram)

| Enneagram | Type             | Score |
| --------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| 7         | The Enthusiast   | 29    |
| 8         | The Challenger   | 23    |
| 2         | The Helper       | 19    |
| 5         | The Investigator | 18    |

**Type 7 - The Enthusiast** - Spontaneous, versatile, and variety-seeking. Sevens are the most enthusiastic and outgoing type — they find life exhilarating and fill their calendars with things to do. They are future-oriented, quick, and talkative. At their best, they are appreciative, accomplished, and deeply grateful. Their challenge is staying focused rather than scattering their energy across too many things.

**Type 8 - The Challenger** - Self-confident, decisive, and confrontational. Eights are natural leaders who take initiative and make things happen. They are protective and empowering, with a "can-do" attitude and a strong sense of honor — their word is their bond. At their best, they are heroic, magnanimous, and use their strength to champion others.

**Type 2 - The Helper** - Caring, empathetic, and generous. Twos are the most people-oriented type, focusing on relationships and supporting others with attention and care. They remember the details of your life and are the first to help. At their best, they are encouraging, loving, and compassionate while also nurturing themselves.

**Type 5 - The Investigator** - Perceptive, innovative, and independent. Fives love the life of the mind, preferring to understand things deeply rather than skim the surface. They have an extraordinary ability to focus their attention on problems until solved. At their best, they are visionary, pioneering, and playful.

### How these assessments tell the same story

These three frameworks — StrengthsFinder, PANAS, and Enneagram — independently converge on the same person:

**Energy into action** — Activator (SF) maps directly to Enthusiast (7) and Challenger (8). All three describe someone who can't sit still once a decision is made, who turns thoughts into motion and thrives on getting things going.

**Idea machine** — Ideation (SF) and Investigator (5) both describe a mind that's always looking for connections, fascinated by concepts, and delighted by elegant explanations. The Enthusiast (7) adds the variety-seeking — not just one idea, but all the ideas.

**People and storytelling** — Communication (SF) and Helper (2) both point to someone who is drawn to people, who wants to bring ideas to life for others, and who genuinely cares about the humans in the room.

**Rolling with it** — Adaptability (SF) and Enthusiast (7) both describe someone who doesn't resent sudden detours but actually looks forward to them. Plans are suggestions; the present moment is where the action is.

**Fix what's broken** — Restorative (SF) and Challenger (8) both describe someone energized by problems, who steps up when things are broken and finds satisfaction in making them work again.

**Emotional intensity** — The Mad Scientist (PANAS) ties it all together. High positive and negative affect means all of the above happens at full volume. The enthusiasm is REALLY enthusiastic, the problem-solving is REALLY intense, the caring is REALLY caring. It's the engine that drives everything else — and the thing that most needs managing.
