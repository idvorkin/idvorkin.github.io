Books allow great thoughts to enter our mind and mold us into who we want to become. These are the books that are molding me.

### Overall

**[Seven Habits of Highly Effective People (7H)](/7-habits)** - How to live your life.

That post has lots of call outs to good books - check them out.

**[Essentialism](/essentialism)** A deep dive into habit #2 - begin with the end in mind: You must trade-off. You can do one thing. What is most important? If you didn't have this thing would you buy it? If you didn't have this opportunity, what would you give up for it?

**[Getting things done](/gtd)** A deep dive into habits #1 and #3 - be proactive, and do first things first: Stress free productivity through getting things out of your head and bottom up planning.

**The checklist manifesto** You waste lots of time re-thinking what you know. Create checklists to free you to be creative, and models to better explore the world.

### On emotional health and intelligence

**[Humans are underrated](/humans-are-underrated)** The skills that will be most valuable when robots take over the world.

**[Search Inside Yourself (SIY)](/search-inside-yourself)** How to train emotional intelligence through mindfulness

**[Getting To Yes with yourself](/getting-to-yes-with-yourself)** Handling the hardest negotiating opponent - yourself. I didn't enjoy the presentation of the book, but the essence is excellent.

### On doing the things you want to do.

**The Big Orange Splot** - Live [your dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cPfjzYJcok).

_"He's just like Plumbean!" the people said. "He's got bees in his bonnet, bats in his belfry, and knots in his noodle!"_

_Then, one by one, they went to see Mr. Plumbean, late at night. They would sit under the palm trees and drink lemonade and talk about their dreams._

_And whenever anybody visited Mr. Plumbean's house, the very next day that person would set about changing his own house to fit his dreams._

**The Flinch** The [resistance](/resistance) is the voice in your head that makes you afraid. F#\$ the resistance! This is such an important lesson, I invented, and annually celebrate [jump in the lake day](https://ig66.blogspot.com/search/label/jump_in_lake_day)!

**The Dip** Quit everything that doesn't get you were you want to be.

**V is for Vulnerable** Life is scary, hard, and totally worth it.

### On strategy

**[Essentialism](/essentialism)** You must trade-off. You can do one thing. What is most important? If you didn't have this thing would you buy it? If you didn't have this opportunity, what would you give up for it?

### On being a technologist

    TBD

### On being an entrepreneur

Start Small Stay Small - Maybe you don't want to be a unicorn.

Lean startup - the bible for software startups

Business Model Canvas - Customers, the value you provide them and your strategy.

Traction - Strategies for customer acquisition

### On thinking, storytelling, and presenting

**Ed Emberly's Make a world** The hard part of drawing is seeing, and this book lets you "see" how simple many objects are.
