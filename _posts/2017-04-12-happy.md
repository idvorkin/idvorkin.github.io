Happy is a 5 letter word that many use as the answer to what is the point of life. The follow up question of "How can you be happy" is usually followed by a blank stare, so here's my study of the subject.

### The Three Types of Happy

#### Pleasure through Consumption

The joy of consumption. Eating chocolate, watching TV, procrastinating. This joy is like sweet food, they have a jolt of pleasure, but they go quickly, and leave you wanting more.

#### Satisfaction Through flow, production, and accomplishing hard things

Brooks defines satisfaction with a simple formula: **Satisfaction = What you have ÷ What you want**. You increase satisfaction by achieving goals OR by wanting less.

Flow happens when you're doing something challenging enough to keep you engaged, but easy enough to support progress. This joy sustains for hours—you look up and realize you've just spent 4 hours deep in the work.

Accomplishing hard things builds satisfaction that lasts. The struggle is part of what makes achievement meaningful.

NOTE: Binge watching TV is probably not flow, it's [addiction](/addiction).

#### Meaning through Identity Purpose and Self Actualization

The joy of identity, purpose, and actualization. This happens when you are supporting your identity. The doing can be miserable, but the satisfaction of being who you want to be is powerful, and lasts and lasts. Even thinking about your identity can sustain you.

### Enjoyment is Pleasure++

Arthur Brooks explains that pleasure and enjoyment aren't the same. **Pleasure happens to you; enjoyment is something you create.** Pleasure is fleeting (like eating ice cream alone), while enjoyment lasts because it combines pleasure with two essential elements:

**Enjoyment = Pleasure + People + Memory**

Example: Beer ads never show someone drinking alone—they show friends together, creating memories. That's because advertisers know people buy enjoyment, not just pleasure.

See {% include summarize-page.html src="/build-life-you-want" %} for more on Brooks' happiness framework.

#### Joy is different from Happy

A major part of [my identity](/eulogy) is bringing people joy, so here is my deep dive on [joy](/joy).

#### The prophet on pleasure

From the [prophet](https://poets.org/poem/houses-0):

_Or have you only pleasure, and the lust for pleasure, that stealthy thing that enters the house a guest, and then becomes a host, and then a master? Ay, and it becomes a tamer, and with hook and scourge makes puppets of your larger desires. Verily the lust for pleasure murders the passion of the soul, and then walks grinning in the funeral._

### The Equations of Happy

A good [summary of happiness](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/04/how-increase-happiness-according-research/609619/)

#### 1. Subjective Well-being = Genes + Circumstances + Life

#### 2. Life = Purpose + Friends + Family + Work + Hobby

#### 3. Satisfaction = What you have / What you want

### The Pursuit of happiness

An interesting take on the [pursuit of happiness](https://whatilearnedsofar.com/theory/happiness/). Note, the pursuit of happiness is different from the mood happy.

The pursuit of happiness is not just a journey, but more importantly a skill.

The pursuit of happiness is to the mood happy as climate is to weather. Fairbanks has a harsh climate, but can have some warm days. Even though there are some warm days, it is still a harsh climate.

By contrast, Hawaii is a super climate (or so I'm told) even though it will have the odd day of bad weather.

#### Inner Peace

State of mind where you maintain freedom (ability to choose). Especially the freedom to choose avoiding suffering (the meaning made of mental [pain](/mental-pain)), and [anxiety](/anxiety) (desire to control).

Getting what you want, in the pleasure sense, is not freedom. For example, a junkie wants a hit of heroin, and will do whatever is required to get it. When the fix is delivered, the junkie is not free.

However, getting what you want in the "identity sense", probably is freedom.

#### Passion

An intense emotional response (either positive or negative) toward an aspect of reality, for which there is an automatic experience of value.

Passion (i.e., being passionate about something) is synonymous with caring and suffering (from the Latin word passiō which means suffering).

#### [Compassion](/compassion)

Compassion is about removing suffering, and accepting people as they are. This applies both to others and to yourself.

When someone throws a rock at you, you don't get mad at the rock, you get mad at the person. But no one wants to throw a rock at you they likely did it due to their suffering. So, just as you don't get mad at the rock, don't get mad at the person, get mad at their suffering.

Compassion can be broken down with a time dimension.

| Time    | Behavior    | Practice     | Behavior Definition                                     |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Past    | Forgiveness | Humility     | Give up hope for a better past                          |
| Present | Acceptance  | Gratefulness | Recognizing you have received more than your fair share |
| Future  | Hope        | Patience     | Believe the future can be better than the present       |

- When people behave poorly (in your mind), it is due to their suffering.
- Compassion clarifies the person’s suffering, not the person, is the source of the problem. Suffering is unacceptable. The person is acceptable (see [getting to yes, hard on problems soft on people](/gty)).
- Love, especially as applied to children, is the highest form of compassion a 11/10.
- Sounds like the fundamental attribution error: When you do something wrong, you attribute to circumstance, when others do thing wrong you attribute you malice/incompetence/personality.

### The Three of you

A week ago, I was at a gala, and I ate a few chocolate truffles because they made me happy. I suspect it was wonderful, but honestly I don't remember if that was the case. Even worse, as I try to button up my pants and the pants are too tight, I'm feeling quite unhappy about eating the truffles.

In the above paragraph there were three "I"'s or "selves" being referenced. The present experiencing self, the future remembering self, and the future experiencing self. To concisely refer to these three selves we'll call them the experiencing self, the remembering self, and the future self.

As you think of three different selves there are two big questions. First, when you thinking about the costs and benefits of an action, think through the cost and benefits for the different selves. Second, decide which of the three selves you want to optimize for.

With luck your present self enjoys this post, your future self remembers enjoying the post, and this prompts your future self to re-read and enjoy the post again.

#### Remembering

#### Experiencing

#### Anticipating

### Maximize Enjoyment (Not Just Pleasure)

Remember: **Enjoyment = Pleasure + People + Memory**. Here's how to maximize all three dimensions:

#### Anticipate

Position and anchor experiences with others. For example this incredible sign:

> If you came here to have fun you will. If not, you won't.

Be committed to having a great experience, not attached to a specific one. You can't control the exact experience, but you can maximize your influence—especially by sharing it with others and framing it as memorable.

#### Savor

Be present in the moment. Notice what you're experiencing. Share observations with others—this adds both the "people" and "memory" components while you're still in the experience.

#### Reminisce

Actively recall experiences with the people who shared them. This is why looking at photos with friends is more enjoyable than alone—you're recreating the "people + memory" formula that made it enjoyment in the first place.

### [Your Idle loop](/idle-loop)

#### Peak end rule

We remember according to the peak end rule, the average of the peak event and the last event. This is why you should end your vacations with something awesome (as opposed to fighting with your family). The most cited example of the peak end rule e comes from the world of colonoscopies. Normally the colonoscopy takes 60 minutes and ends with 'maximum pain', if the surgeon artificially extend your colonoscopy to 90 minutes at low pain, the patient remembers the colonoscopy as less painful, even though it contained the "painful colonoscopy" followed by additional less painful colonoscopy.

### [Moments](/moments)

Most of life is auto-pilot (think about how a 2 hour movie, cover years of life). Think about how you drive somewhere and have no idea how you got home. Think about what you had for breakfast yesterday, or even today.

The things you remember are moments. Optimize for them.

In the original, it's about comfort, not pleasure.
