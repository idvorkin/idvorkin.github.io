The top roles for humans will be:

- Places we want a human to be accountable (judge, lawyer, politician).
- Places we need to solve problems for a group of humans (what should our mission be)
- Places we want to talk a human (expert to talk to, leader to inspire, coworker to story tell with, person to negotiate with)

The top skills for humans will be:

- Empathizing
- Collaborating
- Leading
- Story telling
- Buiding Relationships

Two assumptions need for this future. If assumptions are false, it's game over:

- Humans are in charge of economy and the world.
- Perfect imitation of humans won't exist for 200 years.
