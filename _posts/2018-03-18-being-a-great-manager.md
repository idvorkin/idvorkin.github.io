I aspire to be the best manager I can be. I'll often fall short of my goal, but through continuous practice I will get closer. This post will gather my research on being a great manager, enumerate some of my learnings, and inspire me to be my best. Few things make me prouder then this [public feedback on LinkedIn](/static/idvorkin-linked-in-feedback-lastest.pdf) from people who worked with me over several years. I'm also writing a [manager guidebook](/manager-book), which goes into much more depth on management.

## Igor's book of manager

Management is a very broad topic. So I'm creating "Igor's book of manager":

{%include summarize-page.html src="/manager-book" %}

There's a lot of duplication between this post and the manager book and content is slowly migrating to the book as I decide what shoud be in what post

## How will I measure my success?

Acting is easy, but results are hard. Here are the results I measure.

### Coach, empower, build inclusive and supportive culture

- Employee surveys (MS poll, Amazon connections, Amazon tech survey, Amazon Forte)
- Employee referrals and [public feedback (from LinkedIn)](/static/idvorkin-linked-in-feedback-lastest.pdf)
- Employee career velocity relative to median (you can ask me the ratio in person).

### Productive and results-oriented

- Trains run on time and frequently.
- Ruthless prioritization (Shipping is a feature)
- Define and deliver business priorities.

### Great partner to other teams and non-tech partners

- Biz functions understands team and tech constraints
- My team understand constraints and needs of partner teams and biz functions.
- Team not blocked on other teams or biz functions.

## How will I behave to be successful?

As I tell my teams, the what lags the how, here's my how.

### Being a great coach

- The team members are my most important customer, and will be treated as such.
- Coaching is critical to being a great manager - an excellent primer is [The 7 coaching questions](/Coaching-Questions).
- When we remember work, we think about our [peak moments](/moments-at-work).
- [Human Meetings](/human-meetings)
- Building intra-team cohesion
  - Encouraging team to eat lunch together
  - Encouraging team to share their out side of work passions.
  - Building team ownership over individual ownership.
- Team wide appreciation
  - Weekly linked in posts celebrating the team
  - Cook the team breakfast
- Individual specific recognition
  - Continuous on the spot recognition.
  - [Pending] Hand written notes
- Self-service management through fortune cookies.

### Communicating clearly

- Keeping everyone informed and proud
- Monthly newsletters
- Draw pictures/pen casts

### Hiring

- Public posts on career, management and life [Work Life Balance](/sustainable-work) and [Job Hunting](https://idvorkin.github.io/?q=job-hunt).
- Weekly linked in posts celebrating the team
- Memorable [job descriptions](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/idvorkin_happyabrdance-activity-6461383015967920128-np6b)

### Working across teams

- Ease at which my team can collaborate across the larger organization.
- Leadership card experience
- Team wide engagement through clustering [exercises](https://www.oxfordhomeschooling.co.uk/blog/brainstorming-clustering/).

### Staying technical

_This is answered directly in Igor's [book of management](/the-manager-book)_

### Hack-a-thons

- I finally hosted a hack-a-thon for my parent team. Here is my advice for folks setting this up.

### Some behaviors I'm just starting, these include

- Team music videos
- Engineering peak moments

### Establishing Process, Project Lifecycle, and Artifacts

Some teams have these things well defined and running smoothly, other teams (seems to be most) need help building out these mechanisims

## Igors Super Powers

### What is Igor's Management Philosopy

For some reason this is a frequent question I get asked by people deciding if they should join the team. It's super vague, so I need to think through where I'd like to answer.

First a disclaimer, Managers are professional story tellers, they lie (often by accident), look with your own eyes, ask others on the team.

Philosophy is probably two things

1. What/How of the team
2. What/How is the managers contribution.

What/How - What is the ideal team culture.

What/How - What is the managers part in that.

### Why do people think Igor is a good coach?

Someone once asked me why I'm a good coach, took me a while, here's what I came up with.

- I believe you can't be efficient with people, you can only be effective. And it always pays off.
- People are not 'resources', they are 3 dimensional humans, with [lives outside work](https://bit.ly/igor-wlb-manifesto), emotions(like [pride](/pride)), and [mind monsters](/mind-monsters).
- I actively study and practice [coaching](/coach), effective [decision making](/decide) and [grand mother mind (e.g. non judgement )](/grandmother-mind)
- I've read and digested slews of [self help books](/books) which while often mocked, are filled with great models.
