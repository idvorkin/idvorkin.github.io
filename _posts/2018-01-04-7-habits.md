Need a user manual for life? For me, that's The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. From dependant, to independent to interdependant, and then rinse and repeat for the the different roles in your life. Like other self-helf books? Excellent chance it's a reframe or deep dive into these concepts.

| ----------------------- | -------- |
| Dependant (**Them**)    | [l1](l1) |
| Independent (**Me**)    | [l2](l2) |
| Interdependant (**We**) | [l3](l3) |
| Renewal                 | [l4](l4) |

Very funny, in the 7 habits of highly effective teens they list the anti-habits. Very funny when you see them listed out ...

| Anti Habits                  | Description                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Be Reactive                  | Let your negative emotions run wild               |
| Begin without a destination  | Don't think where you're going                    |
| Start with least important   | start by minutia                                  |
| Think Win Lose               | How can you make sure others aroudn you lose      |
| Talk More; Prented to listen | You already know the answer, why bother listening |
| Never Co-operate             |                                                   |
| Wear yourself out            | You can always have more coffee and crash         |

I use the concepts in this book as the basis of my self improvement and coaching. To help me internalize the 7 habits, I'm creating [video summaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1J7GM3GLzw&list=PLJveOxX-mxxCl4YDfHMyNzMmWUMFxgC1n) of the key concepts.

A little picture I drew when I'd just discoverved the 7 habits ...

### Sharpen the saw

- Did you do your habits today?

### Begin with the end in mind

- Re-read your [eulogy](/eulogy)
- What does success look like
- How are my outcomes different when I begin with the end in mind?
- What legacy do I want to leave?
- This week, what relationship can I invest in?
- Who is most affected by my mission statement?
- Am I over investing in one role at [the expense of another role](/balance)?

### First things First

- Stay in quadrant 2
- What one thing can I do, that if invested regularly, would have a tremendous positive influence on my life?
- What quadrent am I spending most of my time in? What is the consequence?
- How many of my crisis could be avoided if I sepnt more time in quadrant 2?

### Sharpen the Saw

- Is technology helping me, or is it hurting me?

### Be Proactive

- Pause between stimuls and response
- Who has helped me be grow?
- Stop using reactive language
- Use empowering lanuage (I choose, I will)
- Is this in my circle of incluence, or circle of concern?

### Synergize

- How can I compliment someone around me?

### Think Win/Win

- If it's not WIN/WIN, it's LOSE/LOSE.

### First Understand

- Imagine an eye doctor tried to make you use their glasses
