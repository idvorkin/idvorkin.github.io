Before you can negotiate with others, you need to be in sync with yourself. This book applies the [negotiating principles](/gty) to yourself. It's an awkward application of the model, but this book is filled with good concepts regardless.

### 1) Put yourself in your shoes &#x2611;

- **Figure out what your elephant REALLY wants (Switch)**
- **Seek first to understand yourself (7H)**
- **When you judge yourself, you shutdown and can't find what you really want**
- **Acceptance induces safety, and only from safety can you find what you really want**
- See yourself form the balcony
  - Respond instead of reacting.
  - Going to Balcony == Be Mindful, Self Aware and Objective
  - Choose your response, but it's a two sided stick and you get the consequences.
  - Reaction:
    - Feels good, but need to realize there is a VERY negative consequence.
    - Negative Reactions: Attack (Win:Lose) -> Accommodate (Lose:Win) -> Avoid (Lose:Lose)
  - Use self-awareness to catch your desire to react
    - Need to build self-awareness muscle (SIY)
    - Practice mindfulness (and have a grounding spot)
    - Practice mindfulness before event to make it easier.
- Listen with Empathy
  - 80% of thoughts are negative.
  - Observe self: Detached view of a scientist.
  - Listen to self: What it feels like to be you.
  - Listening to self exercise
    - Don't judge, or they will not feel safe, and won't talk.
    - Name your neurosis, and sit them down at a table, and listen to them non-judgementally
    - Because "negative emotions are safe to speak" they get less power, and have less desire to attack at "bad" times.
    - Don't just listen, understand the cause, and what you can do to help.
    - Be curious, ask yourself, isn't that interesting. Ask the neurosis, why is that.
  - This is an opportunity to learn physical self awareness, to help notice your emotions.
  - Huge benefit, your mind is more clear, and you silence the self to concentrate and get into flow.
- Uncover your needs
  - Your elephant is non-verbal, negative emotions are it's mode of communicating your needs.
  - Dig hard for your needs, don't settle for a position, but why, what do you really want. What is done. (XREF: Essentialisim)
  - Magic Question Why? Why? Why?
  - Deepest needs: Happiness: Protection/Safety and Love/Connection
- From Self Judgment to Self Understanding
  - Before fighting with others, need to make sure you TRULY know what you want.
  - Accepting yourself for who you are is NOT a cop out. Acceptance produces safety, which lets us digg deater.

### 2) Develop your inner BATNA &#x2611;

_The ideas in this chapter are great, but I think connecting the concepts to inner BATNA is awkward. Thus my summary doesn't track well with the books_

- A cross between 7H: Be Proactive, AND take responsibility for meeting your own needs.
- When you COMMIT to unconditionally take care of your needs, you have all the power.
  - SWITCH: Your elephant can rest assured it will be fed and cared for regardless of what's going on externally.
  - This gives you much more psychic space in your relationships, making them better relationships.
  - SIY: [Grandmother mind](/grandmother) - you are your own best grandma.
- Responsibility holds Power VS blame gives it away.
- Take responsibility for what you've got, and make the most of it - DO NOT BLAME Life ([welcome to Holland](/welcome-to-holland)).
- Focus on what you can do to make things better, NOT the fact that you screwed something up in the past.
- In a relationship, focus on what YOU CAN DO going forward in the relationship, not on blaming the other person. Doing this:

  - Gives clarity to your needs in the relationships.
  - Gives "psychic space" for other party in relationship
  - Lets you be objectives about your needs, and your expectations from other party.

- Own your life
  - Need self-understanding and self-responsibility
    - Just self-understanding => self-pity
    - Just self-responsibility => self-blame.
  - Self blame => Past looking, I WAS a failure.
  - Self responsibility => Forward looking what CAN I do to make this successful?
  - (really it's the next section, where 'self/life' is the relationship)
- Own your relations
  - When you point a finger at someone, 3 fingers point back at you.
  - All relationships are two ways streets, if there's a problem, you own a CHUNK.
  - Leave the blame territory, and enter the how do we improve this in the future territory.
  - Know what you bring to the relationship, and what is negotiable and non-negotiable from the other party
  - Great Anecdote on divorce requirements.
- Own your needs
  - BATNA, how you satisfy your needs in case you can't get a WIN/WIN?
  - Inner BATNA - know YOU WILL ALWAYS meet your needs, so don't have to worry.
  - Gives you confidence that you don't need to be desperate.
- From blame to responsibility
  - Touching story about author's dying daughter Gabi, and how hard it was to deal with doctors.
  - Two top changes:
    - Needed to stop expecting things from doctor's they could provide for themselves, and let dr's bring only what they needed to bring, their expertise.
    - Needed to stop blaming life for a bum deal, and instead take responsibility for making the most out of what they had.

### 3) Reframe your picture &#x2610;

**Abundance not Scarcity: A rising tide raises all boats**

**Expectations are a self fulling prophecy. Believe the world good or bad, and that's how you'll interpret it, and that's how it will become**

- Remember your connection to life
- Make your own happiness
- Appreciate life's lessons
- From unfriendly to friendly.

### 4) Stay in the zone &#x2610;

- Learn to let go
- Accept the past
- Trust the future
- Embrace the present
- From resistance to acceptance

### 5) Respect them even if &#x2610;

- Put yourself in their shoes
- Expand your circle of respect
- Respect them even if they reject you
- From exclusion to inclusion

### 6) Give and Receive &#x2610;

- Give for mutual gain
- Give for pleasure and meaning
- Give what you are here to give
- From Win/Lose to Win/Win/Win

### 7) The 3 wins &#x2611;

- **How do we get what we want, while meeting the needs of others?**
- **The better we meet our own needs, the better we can meet the needs of others**
- **We choose to be our own ally or our enemy. and we choose to be the ally or enemy in our relationships.**
- A win within
  - **I will give myself the most trouble today. I stand in the way of my goals.**
  - **Do the practices in this book, to be satisfied with yourself**
- A win with others
  - **Every thing you do to get to yes with yourself, makes it easier to get to yes with others**
- A win for the whole
  - When you succeed with yourself, and with others, then the whole world benefits
- Winning the game of life
  - It's about creating inner satisfaction, which makes your life and relationships better. It's hard but worth it.
