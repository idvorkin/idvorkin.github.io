I started writing a technical blog to help me remember the many things I explore. One day, I realized I've got a real life too. Here's a place I can remember the many things I explore IRL (In real Life)

## Physical Health

My post for others at [physical health](/physical-health)

{%include summarize-page.html src="/physical-health" %}

### Personal Trainer

At 42 I got a personal trainer. Should have done it years ago. Several benefits:

1. Externalized Motivation
2. Externalized research.
3. Can turn off brain, and PT tells you what to do so you don't even have to think about exercises or count.

### Calf Health

When I crossed 40 I went from easily running 4 miles hard and 20-mile bike rides to have my calves lock up after 20 minutes of biking. I've tried various calf things here's my current list:

- Calf rocker - I have the single and double, best, simple stretch
- Neoprene Calf Sleeves - I've tried socks but they are a pain to get on, and not adjustable. These things wrap on, keep you warm, and are wonderful. Highly recommend.

{%include amazon.html asin="B001HTFZZ8;B074734XJY" %}

### Knee Health

Lots of sleeves out there, I recommend the most flexible one that provides the pain relief. For me that:

- [Knee brace Softest](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BINV84/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- [Knee brace more support](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019GDFN6W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

{%include amazon.html asin="B005BINV84;B019GDFN6W" %}

### Booger Health

For much of my 30's I had a brutal hacking cough. At 41, those coughs were causing me to pull out my shoulder muscles so I decided to take Flonase (I knew it was postnasal drip). I started taking Flonase, and I'm blown away by not coughing up a hairball.

### Skin Health

I suffer from Eczema, which I normally ignore. I took some of my son's topical steroids, and I kid you not, it cleared up in 2 days.

I also have dry skin, so use O'Keeffe's which is awesome.

### Wrist Health

Several braces for different times

- [Full Immobilization Sleeping](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YIFA04/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- [Heavy support during the day](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NLGNW8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- [Light support during the day](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072392YGD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- [Tight Warm Fingerless Gloves](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VTR6MDM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

### Books on injury prevention

Get 'em both

{%include amazon.html asin="1628604220;1735728500" %}

### Standing Desks

### Gym Stuff

With age comes the need for more accouterments

- Headphones
- Dry bag for iPad
- Eye Drop (Blink)
- Shaving Kit
- Netflix downloaded shows

### Under Desk Exercise Equipment

I don't use this, but it's under my desk. The day I got it and used it, I decided it was a good idea and I should use it more often.

## [Emotional Health](/emotional-health)

### Meditation

{%include summarize-page.html src="/siy" %}

**OLD**

I used to have a complex meditation routine, which was very "focused", but had too much complexity. I skipped it and now use headspace, and do it slouching in a chair. Huge improvement.

I meditate kneeling (Seiza) and have two benches. Meditation benches are overpriced, but if it improves my emotional health (and it's supposed to) it's worth it.

Even though this is folding, this is my permanent bench:

<https://www.bluecony.com/collections/ikuko-meditation-bench>

This is my portable bench, it's smaller, but less stable, but it does the job:

### Therapist

I've been seeing a therapist weekly since my early 30's. It provides me several benefits.

- A chance to introspect, and reflect on what's on my mind.
- A chance to get some analytic analysis over my emotions.
- A cathartic release
- Access to a less distorted (it's still subject to my inputs) view of my reality.
- An early reminder for when my worldview is getting both too positive, and too negative.
- Coaching on relationship-based discussion
- A constant reminder of the importance of my emotional health
- A historical reminder of previous states

## Cognitive Health

### Blogging

### Weekly goals

## Identity Health

### Eulogy Writing

[My own eulogy](/eulogy)

## Personal Carry

### Fanny Pack

Don't get me started on the perfect fanny pack. My current favorite is below. It's very tactical-looking - but have to start somewhere.

{%include amazon.html asin="B07JJYCTST" %}

### Gym Bag

I often stuff the gym bag in a larger bag so small matters - I use:

{%include amazon.html asin="B07SJ5XSB2" %}

### Work Bag

It's taken me several tries, but I've concluded I like the smallest bag possible. I use a 13" MacBook Pro laptop and an iPad Pro 10" and this is the perfect bag for me:

There's also the horizontal version - which is slightly bigger but also nice:

{%include amazon.html asin="B07WNPPF72;B07H4QYC2D" %}

### Selfie Sticks

It's great to have a selfie stick for every occasion

- [Smallest](https://www.amazon.com/Vproof-Bluetooth-Lightweight-Aluminum-Extendable/dp/B07QY8L3WC/)
- [Small w/stand](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082HRRCGD?ref=nb_sb_ss_w_as-ypp-rep_ypp_rep_k0_1_13&crid=1HT7AE28KNQQ5&sprefix=compact+selfi)
- [Big w/stand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09681HV3L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

{%include amazon.html asin="B09681HV3L;B082HRRCGD;B07QY8L3WC" %}

## [Biking](/bike)

I **love** not driving. Biking is an awesome form of transit. It took a while but I concluded I have several use cases so need several bikes. In fact,

## Car Tech

### Tony

Right, now a days it's all about Tony

{%include summarize-page.html src="/tesla" %}

### Tech (Old)

I've gotten 3 cheap pieces of aftermarket tech that transformed my car to awesomeness:

- Remote car starter - ~ 200\$ and you can start your car from the house so that it's warm and toasty when you get in.
- [Wireless CarPlay](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08FG2XRBP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). OMG - having CarPlay (especially on iOS 13) without plugging in your phone - wow!
- Back up Camera ~ 30\$. OMG - Hard to believe I went years without one.

{%include amazon.html asin="B08FG2XRBP" %}

## Tech

- iPhone Pro
- iPad Pro
- Apple Pencil
- AirPod Pros
- Bose QC35 - They're great, but when using a mac the Airpod Pros are so much better
- Bose 900 - I don't like these. They can't swap through devices.
- Foam Tips for AirPod Pros - highly recommend if you're used to foam tips.
- iPad stand.

### How to add a poison pill to the addictive iPhone

- Remind myself to uninstall TikTok
- Put phone in black and white (Accessibility -> Color Filter -> Black and White)
- Set Screen Time to 1-hour limit

### Computers

- Huawei Matebook X (Essentially Windows MacBook clone)
- MacBook Pro (usually at work)
- Ancient Desktop (upgrade coming)
- MacBook Pro M1 - Fantastic device, super light, long-lasting battery.

### Monitors

- 34" wide screen - not a huge fan. Good for widescreen movies (but Netflix/YouTube rarely has this resolution)
- 40" 3840x2160 - Awesome, I love it! Highly recommend
- [Beefy Monitor Stand](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BXP9LT6) - If you're getting a good monitor make sure it floats with a pneumatic monitor stand.

{%include amazon.html asin="B01BXP9LT6" %}

### Keyboards

{%include blob_image_float_right.html src="blog/dual_keyboard.jpg" %}

I had lots of wrist issues from 20 years of typing. If I use a laptop or straight keyboard my wrists hurt on low days. So I need ergo keyboards. Here's the rambling story

- I used to use an iconic MS Sculpt, they stopped making that forever ago, luckily I bought like 6 spares.
- I switched to the Logitech Ergo K860, which is similar and has Bluetooth, but has an annoying number pad.
- Then I realized, my wrist pain actually comes not being able to [externally rotate my shoulders](/shoulder-pain), and a bigger split (like hands 3 feet apart), would support that, so I got the [Kinesis Freestyle (Quiet)](https://kinesis-ergo.com/products/#keyboards)
  - Awesome having the ability to go really wide - but sucks that it's wired across the split and plugs in over USB A.
  - BTW I tried the Kinesis Advantage, I really don't like the ortholinear keyboards.
- Then I discovered, I can do 2 folding split Bluetooth keyboards, and patch the software to still work with [Karabiner Elements](https://github.com/idvorkin/settings/blob/d37d021f27bdec58dfd9e80fc727d9c00f5c103d/mac/multi_keyboard_sync.json?plain=1#L210), which is what I'm using as my coffee shop setup.
- Bluetooth [Folding Split Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/iClever-Rechargeable-Bluetooth-Smartphones-IC-BK06/dp/B01JA6HG88) - I have literally bought 9 of these!

{%include amazon.html asin="B07ZWK2TQT;B01JA6HG88;B0FGN9GC2G" %}

- Notes on mechanical keyboards:
  - I deliberately decided not to get into mechanical keyboards.
  - But the Freestyle only comes in mechanical, so I got stuck.
  - The Advantage Quiet uses linear keys (cherry red), which I like much more than clicky.
  - Eventually I gave up trying to avoid mechanicals and embraced them.
  - My current favorite is the [RK ROYAL KLUDGE Ergonomic Mechanical](https://www.amazon.com/RK-ROYAL-KLUDGE-Ergonomic-Mechanical/dp/B0FGN9GC2G) because you can hot-swap the switches - meaning you can replace individual keys without soldering!

{% include alert.html content="⚠️ CRITICAL: Make sure whatever mechanical keyboard you get has hot-swappable keys! This lets you replace individual switches without soldering. Total game-changer." style="warning" %}

- Notes on my wrist problems:
  - Most of my career my wrists would flair for a week or so, I'd wear a brace and be fine in a week.
  - In 2022, my wrists completely gave out (after 24 hours of straight magic practice)
  - After lots of physical therapy, I discovered I don't have the ability to [externally rotate my shoulders](/shoulder-pain),
  - That's why the split is so helpful.
  - I did like a year of [shoulder work](/shoulder-pain), and now I'm better - thanks for asking!
  - Also zero grip strength (like I couldn't squeeze 15 lbs, now I do 135)

My Dual Keyboard

## Camera

I ended up getting an m200 because a time of purchase it was the only cheap cannon with clean HDMI output. I'd have preferred the m50, but it didn't have clean HDMI output which was a deal-breaker. My use case is mostly video recording or webcamming on a tripod, but I'll take it out of the house occasionally.

[Canon m200](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XYPVFCH/) - Not ideal, but the only m-series with clean HDMI out. Biggest gaps - 1) No MF button 2) 4K sucks 3) A bit too small for SLR lenses

[HDMI to USB](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0894DDD7H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - Be glad I found this, I took several tries to find one that was good.

[Fake Battery](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KC7QCM1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) Weird, it's like it's the early 2000s

{%include amazon.html asin="B07XYPVFCH;B0894DDD7H;B07KC7QCM1" %}

[Very good lens - F2.0/22mm](https://www.amazon.com/Canon-0-866-Compact-System-proyecci%C3%B3n/dp/B008NF8BRI/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=canon+f2+22m&qid=1599424169&s=electronics&sr=1-1) - Pancake lens for the win. A bit too wide for a webcam that's behind your monitor

[Awesome Lens - F1.4/30mm](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081QNNCCJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - Super expensive, but awesome bokeh with a reasonable zoom works great at 2 feet.

{%include amazon.html asin="B081QNNCCJ;B008NF8BRI" %}

[Wrist Strap](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017L3689K/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - Wrist straps much better than neck strap.

[Stream Deck](https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-XL-customizable/dp/B07RL8H55Z/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=stream+deck+xl&qid=1599424060&s=electronics&sr=1-2) - Sounds silly but awesome for controlling OBS. Probably worth its own post.

{%include amazon.html asin="B07RL8H55Z;B017L3689K" %}

Bags - who knows!

## Virtual Reality - Oculus

I'm a big fan of my Oculus Quest, it's my favorite home workout tool for boxing.

Games I like:

- Thrill of the Fight (TOTF) - Great boxing game, just focused on boxing dynamics
- Creed - Boxing game that looks more like a game, but not as good of a working

Experiences worth trying:

- The line: A really nice VR Story.

Games that are OK:

- Climb 2 - Try rock climbing, easy to get into.
- Jupyter - Swing like Spider-Man
- Gorn - Super silly, bloody, gladiator game
- Robo Recall - Really fun shooter, and rip the limbs of robots and beat them with it.

Hardware Accessories:

- [Better Head Strap](https://www.amazon.com//dp/B08MFH6V6C) - Oculus one breaks, I got this one.
- [VR glasses](https://www.framesdirect.com/virtuclear-lens-inserts-for-oculus-quest-2.html) - Put glasses on the Oculus lenses, works awesome
- [Facial Interface](https://vrcover.com/oculus-quest-2/) - Very nice, blocks external light, and comfortable

## Backyard

The best part of coronavirus is the isolation made me feel good about getting temporary things for the backyard - for example.

### Inflatable Hot tub

I've wanted a hot tub for 20 years, but it was so hard. Turns out you can buy an inflatable one on Amazon. Trivial to use and works great. Just plug it into 110v power, fill with water, and wait for it to heat up. 2 days later it's ready to go, and from that point forward it stays hot.

You also need bromine to keep the nasties out and pH up to keep the bromine working.

{%include amazon.html asin="B01NCQO3KY;B07PFCV894;B00PZZFVFE" %}

I also got these chairs which Amelia likes, but are not too useful for a grown-up

And don't forget pool lights - I'm still figuring that out.

{%include amazon.html asin="B00NB3P98G;B00B9CHBK0;B07H8QX8C1" %}

For draining the pool you need a pump, and for rapid heating a propane water heater. I like this:

{%include amazon.html asin="B000CQ6CU4;B08CDHX8VD" %}

Some good links:

1. Run a winter setup with a [propane water heater](https://www.outsidemodern.com/use-inflatable-hot-tub-winter-cold/)
2. Documentation for [the tub](https://m.bestwaycorp.com/Product/Detail/1090363XXX20#pro-support)

### Propane Fire Pit

Who doesn't like fire, just plug in the propane, turn the dial, and you've got a fire ready to go for enjoyment or some s'mores

{%include amazon.html asin="B07ZVS4YPN" %}

Add the fire pit glass and cover and you're good to go.

### Canopies

A simple pop-up canopy, up in 10 minutes, and provides rain protection. Not the sturdiest in a wind storm, but such is life.

{%include amazon.html asin="B01AQILB3A" %}
