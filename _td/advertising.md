## Why Advertise

### What is a brand?

A brand is the way a company, organization, or individual is perceived by those who experience it. More than simply a name, term, design, or symbol, a brand is the recognizable feeling a product or business evokes. [Copied from here](http://www.ignytebrands.com/what-is-a-brand/)

Brands, then, live in the mind. They live in the minds of everyone who experiences them: employees, investors, the media, and, perhaps most importantly, customers.

Simply put, brands are perceptions.

### The bottleneck for someone using your brand

At the end of the day, many products and brands are fungible, solving an identical customer need, modulo, competing for the same dollar. To pick which brand gets to solve the product (and be paid), the customer needs to think of your brand (discovery), and believe your brand is best.

Advertising both of these.

### How much should a brand spend Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Customer Life Time Value (CLTV)

Once a customer is subscribed to something, they likely won't switch. This means you can compute the CLTV of a customer and so long as the CAC is greater then CLTV, it's worth spending.

### No room in the camera

I'm not sure if this accurate, making it up. Snap had a challenge when it started life, because it was a camera company and there was no where to place ad invetory.

### Sponsored Lenses where a novel ad product, which they addded.

### Sponsored Stories where also a novel ad product, which they added.

## Other concept

### Gorilla Marketing

Guerrilla techniques mostly play on the element of surprise. It sets out to create highly unconventional campaigns that catch people unexpectedly in the course of their day-to-day routines. Youâ€™ll see what that looks like in some the examples below.
