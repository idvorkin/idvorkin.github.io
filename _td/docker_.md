## Useful commands and notes

- **docker stats** - Show how much memory is being used
- docker attach - connect to stdio
- docker run -it image - run image in interactive mode, with a terminal
- docker build -t image_name directory name - build and assign it a tag
- Kill all stopped containers - `docker rm $(docker ps --filter status=exited -q)`
- Erase dangling containers
  docker volume rm \$(docker volume ls -qf dangling=true)

## TUI

- lazydocker

## Real applications, my blog

### Requirements

I work on my blog on multiple machines. But the software execution dependancies are hard, and can be error prone. I will try setting it up so the server and build software runs in a container, but file editing stays on my local machine.
