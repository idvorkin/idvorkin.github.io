### Voice Control

You can take full control with Voice Control; this lets you dictate without starting with Siri and tap on buttons. Go look up accessibility -> Voice Control.

Try "Siri Turn on/Turn off voice control." Useful commands:

- You can dictate without tapping the microphone button
- Open [app]
- Show names to see tap targets by name
- Tap Name/Number
- Show numbers/Show numbers continuously

### Speech Controller/Read aloud

This feature allows your phone to be a screen reader. Turn on Speech Controller, and you'll get a little overlay button. Tap it once, and you can select an element, and it will be read. You can only go up to 2x read speed, but it's a start, especially if you can't look at the screen.

### Background noises

You can turn on background noise to be comfortable in a loud environment.
