## SICP

Cool interactive version: [Nice Version](https://xuanji.appspot.com/isicp)

- Amazing this video series is from 1986. So many concepts have sort of gotten their way into modern programming languages.
- [ ] Really fun learning programming from these guys as they're so excited

## LISP

List processing, this is the key! All you do is process lists. Unlike other languages, everything is a list.

A list (+ 3 4) can be an expression, or define a variable, or define a function.

Because everything is a list, including the source tree, you can interact with the source tree at run-time (ala reflection) or at compile time via (macros)

Because everything is a list you have to look more closely then in other languages.

A list with nested lists is a tree. A list in LISP is implemented as a link list. If each tree has 2 children, then a b-tree, else a regular tree.

LISP is not a functional programming language, though functions are first class citizens. Modifining variables is a common situation, using (set )

Because there are no operators, we can redefine any symbox we want.

We don't write math like this.

## Racket: Modern Lisp

## VIM Integration

### Formatter

- Setup NeoFormat with raco format
- `raco pkg install fmt`

### Conjure (NVIM editor plugin)

Cool interactive editor

- \ee -> execute the current inner form
- \er -> execute the current outer form
- \eb -> execute the entire buffer
- \lR -> Reset the buffer
- \lV -> View the buffer in a vert split
- \ece -> Execute the code, and paste itino a comment

## FAQ

### Why different then other languages?

It starts with assumption all you need is lambda calculus, e.g just functions, eg.g. just expressions. There are no statemetns.

Interestingly if you can pass in functions, then you can have functions to do the equivalent of statements in other programming languages

### Why is everything recurression?

Actuall, it's more fundamental, it's that everything is na expression, and if everything is an expression, the only looping has to be recurssion

### Why all those wonkey brackets?

The things:

1/ Everything is an expression (aka a function call that returns something)
2/ The only syntax is prefix notion

This is in contrast to procedural languages which contain statements and think of "functions/sub routines as special".

This corresonds to the models of computation:

1/ The teuring machine

- You interact with a a machine that has variables
- You can set and read variables
- You can do math
- You get language specific control statements
- You can call sub routines

2/ Lambada calculus

- Everything is a function/expression
- Assignment is a function
- Iteration is a function
- Condition is a function

Harder on brain, but more consistent

---

LISP is prefix notation (function args). The upside of this is you never have to guess operator precedence. Everything is consistent, making self editing much easier.

Having everything in prefix notion makes it very consistent and easy to write code, just a bit tough on the brain.

### Why cons, car, cadr

In Lisp, `cons`, `car`, and `cadr` are fundamental functions for list manipulation. In a sane world, they'd have been called make-pair, head, tail

The names `cons`, `car`, and `cadr` come from the historical development of Lisp. Lisp was originally implemented on the IBM 704 computer in the late 1950s. The 704 had an instruction called `CONS` (short for "construct") that was used to create data structures in memory. Similarly, `CAR` and `CDR` stood for "Contents of the Address part of Register" and "Contents of the Decrement part of Register," respectively. These were machine instructions on the IBM 704 that allowed access to different parts of a memory word, which Lisp repurposed for list manipulation.

The terms `car` and `cdr` were retained in Lisp to refer to the first and rest of a cons cell. Over time, as Lisp evolved, additional shorthand functions were created by combining `car` and `cdr` in various ways. These names stuck and became a part of the Lisp family of languages' common vernacular, despite their somewhat cryptic appearance to newcomers.

## Recurssion

### Basis in lambda calculus

### Tail recurusssion

- A way to implement recurussion, but with O(1) space

## Data

### Church encoding

If all you have is substitution, how do you get stuff done?

- Whole Numbers
  - Zero
  - 1: Next(Zero)
  - 2: Next(Next(Zero))
- Booleans ->
- Pairs -> See below
- Lists
  - {} [()](<().md>)
  - {1} (Pair 1 ())
  - {1 2} (Pair 2 (Pair 1 ()))
- Maybes ->

- Recurssion
- Only subsititutions

### Church Pairs

How to create pairs using only substitution. Aka w/o storage. Except, there has to be storage. The storage is the closure of the parent function

<https://xuanji.appspot.com/isicp/2-1-data.html>

```scheme
(define (make_pair x y)
  (define (dispatch m)
    (cond ((= m 0) x)
          ((= m 1) y)
          (else (error "Argument not 0 or 1 -- CONS" m))))
  dispatch)

(define (head pair) (pair 0))

(define (tail pair) (pair 1))
```

or in python

```python
def make_pair(x, y):
    def dispatch(m):
        if m == "head":
           return x
        elif m == "tail":
            return y
        else:
            raise Exception("un supported method")
    return dispatch

def head(pair):
    return pair("head")

def tail(pair):
    return pair("tail")

p1 = make_pair(1,2)
head(p1) # => 1
tail(p2) # => 2
```

Think about that more, that's creating an object at runtime. With a bit of sugar that's could very easily by a class/object sugar

```python
class Pair:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def head(self):
        return self.x

    def tail(self):
        return self.y

p1 = Pair(1,2)
p1.head() # => 1
p1.tail() # => 2
```

### 2.3 Symbolic Data

[Symbolic Data](https://xuanji.appspot.com/isicp/2-3-symbolic.html)

```scheme
(define x 1)
(define y 2)

(list x y) ; => (1 2)

(display "Wait what if i I wanted the actual symbols x and y")

'(x y) ; => (x y)
'(list x y) ; => (list x y)
(list x 'y) ; => (list 1 y)



```

### Object Oriented vs Functional

(object class arg1 arg2)

As long as that first object is a function you can do anything. What's the difference? `object.function` is really just `(function object)` - yup that's an interesting observation on OO.

So long as syntax is always `(function arg1 arg2 arg3)`, if `(method object arg arg)` - isn't that interesting?

### Lazy vs Eager

### Type Systems

### Code as Data

Hymogophony? What if you can edit the source code just as easily as you can edit any other data? To do that parse trees can be much simpler when using prefix notion.

## Modern learning using an excellent tutor

How to learn when you don't know everything. Books are linear.

Really concepts are a dag. so where ever you end, you probably need eveything... And that'st he beter way to go. Ideally the book has this linear aspect to it. The problem with books is.

The problemw ith the interjnnet

### Scheme vs Lisp vs Racket

## Language Eveolution

- Lisp (list procssing)
  - -> Scheme -> Racket
- Algol (procedural)

  - C, Pascal

  -

## Meta programming

### Homoiconicity

Treat code as any other data structure, you can see the length of a code segment

### LISP Macros

<https://www.greghendershott.com/fear-of-macros/>

### LISP Macros vs C Macros

C Macros are just text substitution, they can't do anything that you can't do with text substitution. By contrast lisp macros allow you to make changes to the parse tree. Here's a good idea of what you can do with lisp macros

### Macros vs Reflection

Reflection lets you operate at runtime, while macros change the code at compile time. Compile time is more efficient, but can be less powerful

## Paul graham on the roots of list

Paul has lots of good stuff , you can read through it [http://www.paulgraham.com/lisp.html]. I think his best post was LISP from scratch [here](/static/roots_of_lisp.pdf)

The core idea was you can make all of computing with just 7 primitives! You can then use those to create X helper functions, from which you can then execute the language!

The primitives are:

The helpers are:

The final Eval code:

### Lecture 3B Differentiation

Because we're first class function We can start w/numerical differentiator. Take an input as af unction, and return the output of a function

````python


```rkt
(define (deriv f x)
 (define delta 0.0001)

 ; Derivative is rate of change, rise/run

 ( / (- (f (+x delta))(f x)) delta)
)
````
