## Projects

Finishing projects requires crossing [the dip](/dip), and the best way to do that is quit, or don't even start projects you don't have the energy to complete. To improve my chances of success, I try to have a limited set of projects in flight, and deliberatelly mothball projects I don't think are worth completing.

### Complete

A few that made it over the finish line

- [Ring Video Downloader](ring-video-download)
- [Extract message history on OSX](dump_imessage_history)

### In Flight

Just like kanban, you don't want too many projects in flight, and this list reminds me to limit my open projects.

### On Deck

- Make a single video from all my ring videos
- 3D printing

### Mothballed

Several Projects that I started and deliberately mothballed so I'd have capacity for my other projects

- [Deploy a private web site](private_web_site)
- [Windows Virtual Desktop](virtual-desktops)
- [Alexa Skill](alexa-skill)
- [ManageMe](https://github.com/idvorkin/manage-me)
