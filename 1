Today ends my 6 week summer vacation! We wrapped up the week with a fun family adventure in victoria.

Foods of Victoria

* Peanut Butter Ramen - A bit of a surprise, we looked up the best ramen in Victoria, then we waited in line for an hour, and finally we got the Ramen named after the restaurant.  I probably should have read more about the reviews, as it was peanut butter flavored Ramen. Tasty, bbut weird
* Yummy Dipped cone - serindiptus becaues I wasn't plalning to get one, but Amelia was getting gelato accros sthe street, and gelato place was empty, but accross was packed. And it was a "Famous" dipped cone place from Quebec, this is the only store west of Ontario.  (btw - I love dipped cones, and the only place I can normally get them is Dairy Queen, and when I go, it always feels like a walk of shame)
* High Tea - We went to a cheaper place the empress - fancy looking, but pretty meh.

Have a great week, and remember: Spend time with your kids while you can. It'll be the highlight of your life - ZiaT
