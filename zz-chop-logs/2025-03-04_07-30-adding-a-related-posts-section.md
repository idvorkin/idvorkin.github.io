## Adding a Related Posts Section (3/4/2025, 7:30:35 AM)

_**User**_

Lets work on this post, have a last section which is related post that esummazis all the other relevant stuff

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add a "Related Posts" section to your energy abundance post. This will be a great way to summarize and link to other relevant content on your blog.

Let me first check what related content exists by examining the back-links.json file to find appropriate pages to reference.

---

_\*\*\*\*_

Read file: back-links.json

---

_\*\*\*\*_

Let me continue reading more of the back-links.json file to find relevant content related to energy, productivity, and habits.

I've added a comprehensive "Related Posts" section to your energy abundance post. This section:

1. Organizes related content into logical categories (fundamentals, balance, habits, resistance, etc.)
2. Uses the `summarize-page.html` include to automatically pull in descriptions from each referenced page
3. Creates a natural flow from the core energy concepts to more specific implementation topics
4. Ends with a concluding statement that ties all the resources together

The section is structured to help readers navigate your broader content ecosystem on energy management and productivity. Each summarized page will show a brief description and link to the full content, encouraging deeper exploration of your ideas.

This addition completes the post by providing readers with a roadmap to continue their learning journey through your other relevant content. Is there anything specific you'd like to adjust about this related posts section?
