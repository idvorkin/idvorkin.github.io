## Debugging BBL: File Limits and Logging (3/7/2025, 11:26:20 AM)

_**User**_

look at just bbl, running it fails with too many files open. Also have it be less verbbos in logging. Read hte whole py file

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you investigate the issue with the `bbl` command failing due to "too many files open" and also look at how to reduce its verbosity. Let me first find and examine the `bbl` Python file.

Let me check if there's a script named `bbl` directly:

I see that `build_back_links.py` is likely the script that's being run as `bbl`. Let me read this file to understand what it does and why it might be having issues with too many open files:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

Let me read the rest of the file to understand the full functionality:

Read file: undefined

Let me read the final part of the file to understand the main functionality:

Now I understand the script. Let me check if there's a command-line alias for this script:

Let me check for any shell scripts that might define this alias:

_**User**_

Look in justfile

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll check the justfile to see if it defines the `bbl` command. This is likely where the command is defined.

            <summary>Searched codebase "justfile" • **2** results</summary>

---

_****_

Let me examine the justfile to find the `bbl` command definition:

---

_****_

Read file: undefined

---

_****_

Now I can see that the `bbl` command is likely an alias for the `update-backlinks` command in the justfile, which runs:

```
update-backlinks:
    # Run directly since the script has a uv shebang (#!uv run) and dependencies defined in the script header
    ./build_back_links.py build
```

Let me check if there's a shell alias for `bbl` that maps to `just update-backlinks`:

_**User**_

Stpo it's the just file, go fix too many files open. I think you need a semaphore

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand now. The issue is with the `build_back_links.py` script having "too many files open" errors, and we need to fix it by adding a semaphore to limit concurrent operations. Let me modify the script to address this issue and also reduce its verbosity.

Looking at the script, I can see that the issue is likely in the `process_markdown_paths_in_parallel` function where it's creating too many concurrent tasks without limiting them. Let me fix this:

```

Now I need to update the `update_last_modified_times` method in the `LinkBuilder` class to also reduce verbosity:

---

_****_

```diff
          empty_paths = sum(1 for path in markdown_paths if not path)
          if empty_paths > 0:
-             ic(f"WARNING: {empty_paths} pages have empty markdown_path values")

          last_modified_map = await process_markdown_paths_in_parallel(markdown_paths)
          # Check how many paths got dates
          paths_with_dates = sum(1 for date in last_modified_map.values() if date)
-         ic(f"Got dates for {paths_with_dates} out of {len(markdown_paths)} paths")

          if paths_with_dates < len(markdown_paths):

+                 print(f"  Null last_modified for URL: {url}, Path: {path}")
  
      def canonicalize_outgoing_pages(self):
```

---

_****_

Let's also update the `get_last_modified_time_safe` function to reduce verbosity:

---

_****_

```diff
      try:
          if not file_path:
-             ic("Empty file path provided to get_last_modified_time_safe")
              return ""
  
          # First check if the file actually exists
          if not os.path.exists(file_path):
-             ic(f"File does not exist: {file_path}")
              return ""
  
-         # Log before calling the function
-         ic(f"Getting last modified time for: {file_path}")
- 
          # Get the last modified time
          result = get_last_modified_time(file_path)
- 
-         # Log the result
-         ic(f"Last modified time for {file_path}: {result}")
  
          return result
-     except Exception as e:
-         ic(f"Error getting last modified time for {file_path}: {e}")
- 
-         # Print stack trace for debugging
-         import traceback
- 
-         ic(traceback.format_exc())
- 
+     except Exception:
          return ""
  
```

---

Finally, let's update the `print_json` method to be less verbose:

---

---

Let's test our changes by running the script:

---

Great! The script now runs successfully without the "too many files open" error and with significantly reduced verbosity. Here's a summary of the changes I made:

1. **Added a semaphore to limit concurrent operations**:
   - Implemented an `asyncio.Semaphore` with a limit of 50 concurrent operations
   - Wrapped the git operations in the semaphore context to prevent too many files being open simultaneously

2. **Reduced verbosity**:
   - Configured icecream to be less verbose with `ic.configureOutput(prefix='', includeContext=False)`
   - Replaced most `ic()` calls with `print()` or removed them entirely
   - Reduced the number of debug messages shown for null last_modified values from 10 to 5
   - Removed unnecessary error tracebacks and detailed logging

3. **Simplified error handling**:
   - Removed verbose error messages and tracebacks
   - Simplified the error handling in `get_last_modified_time_safe`

The script now runs much more efficiently and with cleaner output. The total execution time was 3.83 seconds, which is quite fast for processing 277 markdown paths.

Would you like me to make any additional improvements to the script?

No use, ic instead of print, it's beteer as it's rarely called
