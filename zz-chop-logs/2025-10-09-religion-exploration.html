            <div class="thinking-text">The user wants me to review the religion.md file and tell them what they&#x27;re working on. Let me analyze the content and structure.

Looking at the file, I can see:

1. **Title**: &quot;Religion: Losing belief while seeing value&quot;
2. **Opening**: A personal story about the Bar Mitzvah at the Wailing Wall

The post appears to be exploring Igor&#x27;s relationship with religion - specifically Judaism - from multiple angles:

**Structure sections:**
- My story (personal journey with religion)
  - Bar Mitzvah experience
  - When proof became his religion (engineering mindset)
  - The day he valued religion (father&#x27;s death)
  - When someone important found god
- The Hard Parts for Me (critiques)
  - Proof, Hypocrisy, Pushiness, Arbitrariness &amp; Literalism
- The Gifts I want (values he sees)
  - Unconditional love, community, certainty, spiritual guidance, etc.
- Bible verses he likes
- Appendix (still being worked on)

**Content type**: Based on content_guidelines.md, this appears to be a **Personal Philosophy/Identity Post** (Type 2):
- Purpose: Work through fundamental life questions while creating frameworks others can use
- Voice: Vulnerable philosopher - &quot;Here&#x27;s how I think about life&quot;
- Uses personal anecdotes as proof points
- Dialog format for internal conflicts
- Cross-references to related life frameworks
- Length: 400-1000+ lines for major pieces
- Tags: `how igor ticks`, plus relevant topics

**Key themes I notice:**
1. **Tension between intellectual skepticism and experiential value** - the engineer who doesn&#x27;t believe but sees utility
2. **Personal narrative** - Bar Mitzvah, father&#x27;s death, someone close finding god
3. **&quot;To be fair&quot; pattern** - consistently acknowledging counterarguments and nuance
4. **Framework building** - organizing religious gifts/challenges systematically


5. **Vulnerability** - openly discussing struggles with belief while respecting believers

I see the document is a deeply personal exploration of religious identity. The writing reveals an introspective approach to understanding faith, balancing critical analysis with emotional depth. There&#x27;s an ongoing process of working through complex feelings about religion, with some sections still in development. The piece demonstrates a nuanced approach to personal belief, showing respect for different perspectives while maintaining intellectual honesty.</div>

        <div class='content'><p>Looking at <code>_d/religion.md</code>, you're working on a <strong>Personal Philosophy/Identity Post</strong> that explores your complex relationship with religion - specifically your journey from Jewish upbringing through atheist engineering mindset to appreciating religion's practical value.</p>
<h2>What You're Building</h2>
<p><strong>Core Tension</strong>: How to reconcile intellectual disbelief with recognition of religion's utility and beauty. The title captures it perfectly: &quot;Losing belief while seeing value.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Structure &amp; Progress</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>✅ Well-developed sections:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opening story</strong> - Powerful Bar Mitzvah moment with the &quot;That's not God, that's 40 degrees Celsius&quot; line</li>
<li><strong>My story</strong> - Four narrative arcs showing your evolution</li>
<li><strong>The Hard Parts</strong> - Honest critique with the distinctive &quot;To be fair...&quot; pattern acknowledging counterarguments</li>
<li><strong>The Gifts I want</strong> - Systematic framework of what religion offers</li>
<li><strong>Bible verses</strong> - Practical wisdom you connect with</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>🚧 Less developed sections:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&quot;When someone important to me found god&quot;</strong> - Has observations but feels incomplete</li>
<li><strong>Appendix sections</strong> - Brief outlines that could be expanded or integrated</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Writing Style Strengths</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Consistent use of &quot;I&quot; (never &quot;we&quot;)</li>
<li>✅ Vulnerable but analytical voice</li>
<li>✅ Framework thinking (The Gifts, The Hard Parts)</li>
<li>✅ Personal anecdotes as teaching tools</li>
<li>✅ Heavy cross-referencing (anxiety link)</li>
<li>✅ Nuanced &quot;To be fair...&quot; acknowledgments throughout</li>
<li>✅ Clear headers for scanning</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Content Type Match</strong>: This fits <strong>Type 2: Personal Philosophy/Identity Posts</strong> perfectly - you're working through fundamental questions while creating frameworks others can use.</p>
<p><strong>What stands out</strong>: The father's death section is incredibly powerful - showing how religion provided structure when you needed it most. This is where belief vs. practice becomes visceral rather than theoretical.</p>
<p>Would you like to develop any specific sections further, or are you looking for structural feedback?</p>

Let me search for bible verses that encourage questioning, testing, and not taking faith blindly. This aligns with the user&#x27;s engineering mindset and their struggle with &quot;absolute faith, and the inability to question.&quot;

I&#x27;ll search for verses about:
- Testing/examining faith
- Seeking wisdom and understanding
- Questioning and reasoning
- Not following blindly
- The importance of knowledge and discernment

Let me provide several options with context so the user can choose which ones resonate.</div>

I&#x27;ve found several Bible verses about testing faith and questioning God. Here are some key passages:

## Testing of Faith

James 1:2-4 states: &quot;My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing.&quot;(no content)1 Peter 1:6-7 says: &quot;In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by various trials, that the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ.&quot;(no content)Job 23:10 declares: &quot;But he knows the way that I take; when he has tried me, I shall come out as gold.&quot;

## God&#x27;s Testing and Self-Examination

Genesis 22:1-3 describes how &quot;God tested Abraham&quot; by asking him to offer Isaac as a burnt offering.(no content)2 Corinthians 13:5 encourages believers: &quot;Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves.&quot;

## Questioning God

The Bible shows us that God understands our doubts and encourages us to bring them to Him. When we question God, it is not a sign of weakness but of trust in seeking answers from Him.(no content)James 1:5 promises: &quot;If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.&quot;</pre>

I found information about these important Bible verses related to testing teachings and examining Scripture:

## Acts 17:11 - The Bereans

The Bereans were described as &quot;more noble-minded than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if these teachings were true.&quot;(no content)The Bereans tested the apostolic teaching on the basis of its agreement with the Scriptures.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:21 - Test Everything

This verse instructs believers to &quot;test everything; hold fast what is good.&quot; Various translations render this as &quot;examine everything carefully&quot; or &quot;prove all things.&quot;

## Connection Between the Verses

Paul&#x27;s instruction to test everything in 1 Thessalonians 5:21 is still pertinent today, and one must test claims in light of the Scriptures.(no content)The Scriptures are the sole and sufficient criterion for the testing of all teachings that claim to have divine origin and authority.

These verses together emphasize the biblical principle of examining all teachings against Scripture, with the Bereans serving as the model example of this practice.</pre>

- James 1:5 advocates for believers to seek wisdom from God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, implying that wisdom is readily available to those who ask God.
- Colossians 1:9 and Philippians 1:9-10 emphasize asking God for knowledge, wisdom, understanding, and discernment.

The search results include comprehensive collections of verses with commentary on how to apply wisdom and discernment in daily Christian living.</pre>

1. Testing/examining teachings
2. Seeking wisdom and understanding
3. Not being gullible
4. Critical thinking
5. Examining scriptures

Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll suggest:</div>

        <div class='content'><p>Perfect! Here are the bible verses I found for <strong>&quot;Don't take Faith Blindly&quot;</strong>:</p>
<h2>Proposed Verses:</h2>
<p><strong>Testing and Examining:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1 Thessalonians 5:21</strong> - &quot;But test everything; hold fast what is good.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Acts 17:11</strong> - &quot;Now the Bereans were more noble-minded than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if these teachings were true.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>1 John 4:1</strong> - &quot;Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Seeking Wisdom and Understanding:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proverbs 2:3-5</strong> - &quot;Indeed, if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding, and if you search for it as for silver and seek it as for hidden treasure, then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Proverbs 18:15</strong> - &quot;The heart of the discerning acquires knowledge, for the ears of the wise seek it out.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>James 1:5</strong> - &quot;If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Self-Examination:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2 Corinthians 13:5</strong> - &quot;Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>My recommendation</strong>: Use the first 3-4 verses (1 Thessalonians, Acts 17:11, and maybe Proverbs 2:3-5 and James 1:5) to keep it concise and focused on the core theme of testing/examining rather than accepting blindly.</p>
<p>Which verses resonate with you? Want all of them, or a subset?</p>

5. 2 Corinthians 13:5 - &quot;Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves.&quot;

So that&#x27;s 5 verses total. Let me add them to the section. I need to find where the section is and add the content.

Looking at the file, the section is at line 179:
```
#### Don&#x27;t take Faith Blindly

## Appendix and stuff I&#x27;m working in ...
```

So I need to add the verses between lines 179 and 181.

I should format them consistently with the other verse sections in the file. Looking at the other sections:

```markdown
#### Tolerance

- Romans 14:10 - &quot;You, then, why do you judge your brother or sister? Or why do you treat them with contempt? For we will all stand before God&#x27;s judgment seat.&quot;
- Romans 14:13 - &quot;Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister.&quot;

#### Discipline

- Proverbs 27:17 - &quot;As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.&quot;


```

I&#x27;ll format the new verses in a similar markdown list style, carefully placing them in the &quot;Don&#x27;t take Faith Blindly&quot; section. I&#x27;ll ensure each verse is added with its full reference and text, maintaining the existing formatting.

- Proverbs 21:31 - &quot;The horse is made ready for the day of battle, but victory rests with the Lord.&quot;
- 2 Thessalonians 3:10 - &quot;For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: &#x27;The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.&#x27;&quot;

These verses emphasize preparing diligently while acknowledging ultimate outcomes are beyond personal control. Preparation matters, but divine providence guides final results. Hard work is essential, yet humility recognizes larger spiritual frameworks governing success.

   191→Religions persist because they solve hard coordination problems: transmitting values across generations, creating social trust, and providing meaning under uncertainty. They encode “do this, not that” as embodied wisdom, not just abstract rules. My interest is pragmatic: learn from what works, name what harms, keep the parts that build resilient, prosocial humans.</pre>

            <div class="thinking-text">Good, I&#x27;ve added all five verses to the &quot;Don&#x27;t take Faith Blindly&quot; section. The formatting matches the other sections, and the verses are all relevant to the theme of examining faith critically rather than accepting it blindly.

The verses included are:
1. 1 Thessalonians 5:21 - test everything
2. Acts 17:11 - the Bereans examining scriptures
3. Proverbs 2:3-5 - seeking wisdom and understanding
4. James 1:5 - asking God for wisdom
5. 2 Corinthians 13:5 - self-examination

This completes the section and provides good biblical support for the idea that faith shouldn&#x27;t be blind, which aligns well with the user&#x27;s engineering mindset and his concerns about &quot;Arbitrariness &amp; Literalism&quot; mentioned earlier in the post.</div>

<ol>
<li><strong>1 Thessalonians 5:21</strong> - Test everything</li>
<li><strong>Acts 17:11</strong> - The Bereans examining scriptures</li>
<li><strong>Proverbs 2:3-5</strong> - Seeking wisdom like hidden treasure</li>
<li><strong>James 1:5</strong> - Asking God for wisdom</li>
<li><strong>2 Corinthians 13:5</strong> - Self-examination</li>
</ol>
<p>This section nicely addresses one of your &quot;Hard Parts&quot; (Arbitrariness &amp; Literalism) by showing that scripture itself encourages critical examination and testing rather than blind acceptance. The Bereans verse is particularly powerful - they were praised for fact-checking the apostles against scripture.</p>

I need to move it to be the first subsection.

Looking at the structure:
- Line 158: ## Some bible verses I really like
- Line 160: While I struggle with literal belief...
- Line 162: #### Tolerance
- Lines 164-166: Tolerance verses
- Line 168: #### Discipline
- Lines 170-172: Discipline verses
- Line 174: #### You don&#x27;t have control, but you must still do the work
- Lines 176-177: Control verses
- Line 179: #### Don&#x27;t take Faith Blindly
- Lines 181-185: Don&#x27;t take Faith Blindly verses

I need to move lines 179-185 to right after the introductory paragraph (after line 160).

Also need to update the table of contents to reflect this new order.</div>

   190→
   191→Religions persist because they solve hard coordination problems: transmitting values across generations, creating social trust, and providing meaning under uncertainty. They encode “do this, not that” as embodied wisdom, not just abstract rules.

            <div class="thinking-text">Now I need to update the table of contents to reflect the new order. Looking at the TOC, I need to move &quot;Don&#x27;t take Faith Blindly&quot; to be the first item under &quot;Some bible verses I really like&quot;, before &quot;Tolerance&quot;.

Looking at lines 33-36 in the TOC:
```
  - [Tolerance](#tolerance)
    - [Discipline](#discipline)
    - [You don&#x27;t have control, but you must still do the work](#you-dont-have-control-but-you-must-still-do-the-work)
    - [Don&#x27;t take Faith Blindly](#dont-take-faith-blindly)
```

Wait, I see the indentation is wrong. &quot;Discipline&quot;, &quot;You don&#x27;t have control...&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t take Faith Blindly&quot; should be at the same level as &quot;Tolerance&quot; (they&#x27;re all #### subheadings under &quot;Some bible verses I really like&quot;). Let me fix that structure.</div>

1. Moved the &quot;Don&#x27;t take Faith Blindly&quot; section to the top of the bible verses section (after the introductory paragraph)
2. Removed the duplicate section from the bottom
3. Updated the table of contents to reflect the new order with proper indentation

The section is now first under &quot;Some bible verses I really like&quot;, which makes sense given that it addresses one of the user&#x27;s core concerns about religion - the arbitrariness and literalism. Having this section first sets up that even the Bible encourages testing and examining rather than blind acceptance.</div>

            <div class="thinking-text">The user wants me to review the bible verses in the &quot;Don&#x27;t take Faith Blindly&quot; section and see if there are better replacement quotes or additional ones to append.

Let me look at the current quotes:
1. 1 Thessalonians 5:21 - &quot;But test everything; hold fast what is good.&quot;
2. Acts 17:11 - &quot;Now the Bereans were more noble-minded than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if these teachings were true.&quot;
3. 1 John 4:1 - &quot;Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.&quot;
4. James 1:5 - &quot;If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.&quot;
5. 2 Corinthians 13:5 - &quot;Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves.&quot;

These are all good verses about testing, examining, and not accepting things blindly. Let me search for other relevant verses that might strengthen this section or offer different perspectives on questioning/testing faith.

I should look for:
- Verses about questioning God (like doubting Thomas)
- Verses about seeking understanding
- Verses that show biblical figures questioning God and it being okay
- Verses about discernment

Let me do some web searches to find complementary or replacement verses.</div>

I&#x27;ve completed the search for information about the &quot;doubting Thomas&quot; story and the verse &quot;blessed are those who have not seen.&quot; Here&#x27;s what I found:

## The Story Context

Thomas was not present when Jesus first appeared to the other disciples after the resurrection. When they told him &quot;We have seen the Lord,&quot; Thomas responded: &quot;Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will never believe.&quot;

## The Full Passage (John 20:27-29)

Eight days later, Jesus appeared again and said to Thomas, &quot;Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.&quot; Thomas answered him, &quot;My Lord and my God!&quot; Jesus said to him, &quot;Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.&quot;

## Interpretation

Jesus described two groups: those who see and believe, and those who never see and believe. All the disciples saw the risen Jesus, but the vast majority of Christians who have ever lived have not seen and have come to believe.(no content)By saying &quot;blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed,&quot; Jesus assures all subsequent generations that their faith is just as valid and is honored by God.

The search results emphasize that this verse doesn&#x27;t promote blind faith, but rather recognizes that future believers would trust based on testimony and written accounts rather than direct physical evidence.</pre>

I&#x27;ve completed the web search for Isaiah 1:18. Here&#x27;s what I found:

The full verse from Isaiah 1:18 reads: &quot;Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord; though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.&quot;

The search results provide various interpretations and contexts for this verse:

**Meaning and Context:**
The phrase &#x27;Come Let Us Reason Together&#x27; is a call from God to His people, urging them to turn from their sinful ways and seek reconciliation with Him.(no content)God describes the people of Judah as rebellious children, a sinful nation that has turned its back on God.(no content)This invitation from God demonstrates His willingness to forgive and cleanse us from our sins, no matter how deep or stained they may be.(no content)It&#x27;s a loving conversation between a caring God and His people.

**Historical Context:**
By the time of Isaiah, Israel had split into two separate kingdoms: Israel in the north and Judah in the south. Isaiah himself tells us that he prophesied over Judah during the reigns of four kings (1:1), beginning in the year that King Uzziah died, which was 740 BC (6:1).

The search returned multiple Christian theological sources explaining this well-known verse about God&#x27;s offer of forgiveness and restoration.</pre>

Let me search for one more - maybe something about Abraham questioning God about Sodom and Gomorrah, or Job questioning God, which would show that questioning is acceptable.</div>

            <pre>Web search results for query: &quot;Genesis 18:25 &quot;will not the judge of all earth do right&quot; Abraham questions God Sodom bible verse&quot;

No links found.

I can help you with information about Genesis 18:25. This is a significant verse in the biblical narrative where Abraham intercedes with God regarding the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah.

**The Verse:**
Genesis 18:25 is part of Abraham&#x27;s bold dialogue with God. In most translations, it reads something like: &quot;Far be it from you to do such a thing—to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?&quot;

**Context:**
- This verse appears in Genesis 18:16-33, where God reveals His plan to investigate Sodom and Gomorrah
- Abraham bargains with God, asking if He would spare the city if there were 50 righteous people, then gradually negotiates down to 10
- This passage shows Abraham&#x27;s boldness in questioning God&#x27;s justice while also showing deep reverence
- The phrase &quot;Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?&quot; has become a famous expression of faith in God&#x27;s justice

**Significance:**
- It demonstrates the biblical principle of intercessory prayer
- It reveals Abraham&#x27;s concern for justice and mercy
- It establishes God&#x27;s character as righteous and just
- The passage shows that God welcomes honest dialogue and questions from His people

This is one of the most profound examples of human-divine dialogue in Scripture, addressing the theological question of how God&#x27;s justice and mercy work together.</pre>

            <div class="thinking-text">Good! Genesis 18:25 is a great example showing that Abraham questioned God and it was acceptable. Now let me compile my recommendations.

Current verses:
1. 1 Thessalonians 5:21 - &quot;But test everything; hold fast what is good.&quot;
2. Acts 17:11 - Bereans examining scriptures
3. 1 John 4:1 - &quot;test the spirits&quot;
4. James 1:5 - asking God for wisdom
5. 2 Corinthians 13:5 - &quot;Examine yourselves&quot;

Potential additions/replacements:
- Proverbs 14:15 - &quot;The simple believes everything, but the prudent gives thought to his steps&quot; - This is EXCELLENT and directly addresses blind faith
- Genesis 18:25 - &quot;Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?&quot; - Shows questioning is acceptable
- Isaiah 1:18 - &quot;Come let us reason together&quot; - Shows God invites reasoning, though context is more about forgiveness

My recommendation:
- STRONG ADD: Proverbs 14:15 - This is perfect for this section
- CONSIDER: Genesis 18:25 - Shows that questioning God is acceptable
- SKIP: Isaiah 1:18 - While &quot;reason together&quot; sounds good, the context is about forgiveness, not critical examination
- SKIP: Doubting Thomas - The punchline is actually &quot;blessed are those who believe without seeing&quot; which works against the theme

<h2>Current Verses (All Good - Keep Them)</h2>
<p>Your current selection is strong and on-theme. Each directly addresses testing/examining faith.</p>
<h2>Recommended Addition</h2>
<p><strong>STRONG recommendation to ADD:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proverbs 14:15</strong> - &quot;The simple believes everything, but the prudent gives thought to his steps.&quot;<ul>
<li><em>Why it's perfect</em>: Directly warns against believing everything blindly. The word &quot;simple&quot; here means naive/gullible. This is a crystal-clear endorsement of critical thinking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Optional Addition</h2>
<p><strong>CONSIDER adding:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Genesis 18:25</strong> - &quot;Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?&quot;<ul>
<li><em>Context</em>: Abraham questioning God about destroying Sodom, bargaining down from 50 to 10 righteous people</li>
<li><em>Why it fits</em>: Shows that biblical figures questioned God and it was acceptable - demonstrates that dialogue with God is valued, not punished</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recommendations AGAINST</h2>
<p><strong>Skip these:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isaiah 1:18</strong> (&quot;Come let us reason together&quot;) - Sounds good but context is about God offering forgiveness for sins, not about critical examination</li>
<li><strong>John 20:29</strong> (Doubting Thomas) - The conclusion is &quot;blessed are those who believe without seeing&quot; which actually contradicts your theme</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My suggestion:</strong> Add Proverbs 14:15 (definitely), and consider Genesis 18:25 if you want to show that questioning is modeled by biblical heroes. Both strengthen the &quot;Don't take Faith Blindly&quot; theme.</p>

   163→
   164→- 1 Thessalonians 5:21 - &quot;But test everything; hold fast what is good.&quot;
   165→- Acts 17:11 - &quot;Now the Bereans were more noble-minded than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if these teachings were true.&quot;
   166→- 1 John 4:1 - &quot;Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.&quot;
   167→- Proverbs 14:15 - &quot;The simple believes everything, but the prudent gives thought to his steps.&quot;
   168→- James 1:5 - &quot;If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.&quot;

The verse is at line 167 in the file. The user seemed happy with just this addition and didn&#x27;t want Genesis 18:25, so I&#x27;ve completed the task.</div>

            <div class="thinking-text">The user wants me to review the &quot;Tolerance&quot; section and see if there are better replacement quotes to recommend or append, similar to what I did for the &quot;Don&#x27;t take Faith Blindly&quot; section.

Let me look at the current Tolerance section from the file:

```
#### Tolerance

- Romans 14:10 - &quot;You, then, why do you judge your brother or sister? Or why do you treat them with contempt? For we will all stand before God&#x27;s judgment seat.&quot;
- Romans 14:13 - &quot;Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister.&quot;
```

So there are currently 2 verses, both from Romans 14. Let me search for other relevant bible verses about tolerance, non-judgment, loving others, accepting differences, etc.</div>

I&#x27;ve found comprehensive information about Bible verses on tolerance, acceptance, and judging others. Here&#x27;s what the search revealed:

## Matthew 7:1 - &quot;Judge Not&quot;

The famous verse states: &quot;Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you.&quot;

## Luke 6:37

Luke 6:37 provides a parallel teaching: &quot;Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.&quot;

## What This Teaching Means

In this context, Jesus uses the word to refer to condemning others, or treating them with judgmental contempt.(no content)Jesus is telling people not to unfairly judge others in order not to be unfairly judged, talking about having an arrogant attitude: taking the place of God.(no content)This is exactly the kind of contempt Jesus has in mind when he tells his followers not to judge one another.

## Related Verses on Acceptance and Love

Luke 6:35 teaches: &quot;But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.&quot;

The search results emphasize that these verses don&#x27;t prohibit discernment, but rather warn against hypocritical, condemning judgment of others.</pre>

I&#x27;ve completed the web search for your query about &quot;love your neighbor,&quot; the Golden Rule, Matthew 7:12, Leviticus 19:18, and related biblical verses about acceptance. Here&#x27;s what I found:

## Key Biblical Connections

The Golden Rule refers to Matthew 7:12: &quot;So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.&quot;(no content)In Leviticus 19:18, the LORD tells Israel, &quot;You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the sons of your own people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD.&quot;

## Historical Context

Jesus takes the Golden Rule from Leviticus, written about 1450 BC, so Jesus&#x27; source for the Golden Rule predates the &quot;silver rule&quot; by about 1,000 years.(no content)When Jesus spoke His version, &quot;Love your neighbor as yourself,&quot; He was purposefully citing a phrase recorded centuries prior as Jewish law in Leviticus 19:9-18.

## Acceptance and Extension of the Commandment

The most striking innovation in the Gospels is the command to love one&#x27;s enemies, which is framed as an expansion of the laws in Leviticus, as seen in the Gospel of Matthew&#x27;s Sermon on the Mount.(no content)Most Christian denominations view the Great Commandment alongside the law to love one&#x27;s neighbor as forming the core of the Christian religion.

The search results provide extensive theological discussion about these interconnected biblical teachings on loving neighbors and treating others with acceptance and compassion.</pre>

I found several resources discussing Bible verses about favoritism and partiality. Here are the key findings:

**Key Verses on God&#x27;s Impartiality:**

Acts 10:34 states: &quot;I see very clearly that God shows no favoritism.&quot;(no content)This verse continues in verse 35: &quot;but accepts from every nation the one who fears him and does what is right.&quot;(no content)Galatians 3:27-28 declares that &quot;all of you who were baptized into the Messiah have clothed yourselves with the Messiah&quot; and that &quot;all of you are one in the Messiah Jesus, a person is no longer a Jew or a Greek, a slave or a free person, a male or a female.&quot;

**Biblical Teaching on Favoritism:**

The Bible tells us six times that God does not show partiality or favoritism. This includes:
- Romans 2:11: &quot;For God does not show favoritism&quot;
- Deuteronomy 10:17: God &quot;shows no partiality and cannot be bribed&quot;
- Colossians 3:25: &quot;there is no partiality&quot;

**James 2 on Favoritism:**

The Bible speaks plainly about the dangers of partiality, urging us to treat others with fairness, love, and equality, reflecting the character of God who is impartial in His judgments.

The sources provide comprehensive lists of Bible verses addressing this theme across both Old and New Testaments.</pre>

            <div class="thinking-text">Good, I&#x27;ve found several relevant verses. Let me compile my recommendations for the Tolerance section. The current verses are:

- Romans 14:10 - about not judging your brother or sister
- Romans 14:13 - about not passing judgment on one another

Good candidates to add or consider:
1. Matthew 7:1 - &quot;Judge not, that you be not judged&quot; - This is the most famous verse about not judging
2. Luke 6:37 - Similar to Matthew 7:1
3. Matthew 7:12 - Golden Rule
4. Leviticus 19:18 - Love your neighbor as yourself
5. Acts 10:34 - God shows no favoritism
6. Galatians 3:28 - No longer Jew or Greek, slave or free, male or female - all are one

I think Matthew 7:1 is a must-have since it&#x27;s the most famous &quot;judge not&quot; verse. The Golden Rule (Matthew 7:12) is also very strong. And I like Galatians 3:28 for tolerance across different groups.

Let me present these options to the user.</div>

        <div class='content'><p>Based on my search, here are recommendations for the Tolerance section:</p>
<h2>Current Verses (Both Good)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Romans 14:10 &amp; 14:13 - Both solid, specifically about judging fellow believers</li>
</ul>
<h2>Strong Recommendations to ADD:</h2>
<p><strong>MUST ADD:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Matthew 7:1</strong> - &quot;Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you.&quot;<ul>
<li><em>Why</em>: The most famous verse on this topic. Can't have a tolerance section without it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>STRONGLY CONSIDER:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Matthew 7:12</strong> (Golden Rule) - &quot;So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Why</em>: Universal principle that applies to everyone, not just believers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Galatians 3:28</strong> - &quot;There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Why</em>: Directly addresses tolerance across different groups (ethnicity, social status, gender)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ALSO GOOD:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Luke 6:37</strong> - &quot;Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Why</em>: Similar to Matthew 7:1 but adds forgiveness dimension</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Acts 10:34</strong> - &quot;God does not show favoritism.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Why</em>: Short, punchy, establishes God's character as impartial</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My recommendation</strong>: Definitely add Matthew 7:1, and then either the Golden Rule (Matthew 7:12) or Galatians 3:28 depending on whether you want a universal principle or specific group tolerance.</p>

I&#x27;ve completed the web search for Bible verses about discipline, self-control, training, and perseverance. Here are the key findings:

## Proverbs 25:28

Proverbs 25:28 ESV: &quot;A man without self-control is like a city broken into and left without walls.&quot; This verse emphasizes the vulnerability that comes from lacking self-control.

## Hebrews 12:5-11

Multiple sources discuss this important passage on discipline:

Hebrews 12:10-11 states: &quot;They disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share in his holiness. No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.&quot;(no content)Hebrews 12:11 emphasizes: &quot;For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.&quot;

## Related Verses on Training and Perseverance

I found search results containing the Bible verses you searched for. Here&#x27;s what was found:

**Proverbs 12:1:**
The verse states &quot;He who loves correction loves knowledge, but he who hates reproof is stupid.&quot;

**Proverbs 13:18:**
This verse reads &quot;Poverty and disgrace come to him who ignores instruction, but whoever heeds reproof is honored.&quot;

**2 Timothy 1:7:**
&quot;For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline.&quot;

The search results came from collections of Bible verses about discipline, correction, and instruction. These three verses appear in contexts emphasizing the importance of accepting godly discipline and correction, with Proverbs 12:1 and 13:18 highlighting the benefits of receiving instruction, and 2 Timothy 1:7 focusing on God&#x27;s gift of self-discipline, power, and love rather than fear.</pre>

I performed the web search with your query, but the results don&#x27;t show any visible content. This could be because the combination of all those specific Bible verse references in quotes made the search too restrictive.

Would you like me to try a broader search, such as searching for information about these Bible verses and their connection to self-control and perseverance? I could try something like &quot;self-control perseverance Bible verses&quot; or search for the specific passages individually if you&#x27;re looking for commentary or analysis on these verses.</pre>

I&#x27;ve completed the web search. Here&#x27;s what I found:

## Key Bible Verse

Galatians 5:22-23 states: &quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.&quot;

## Understanding Self-Control as a Fruit of the Spirit

Self-control is the last characteristic listed in Galatians 5:22-23 as a fruit of the Spirit, and the fruit of the Spirit is the change in our character that comes about because of the Holy Spirit&#x27;s work in us.(no content)Self-control involves moderation, constraint, and the ability to say &quot;no&quot; to our baser desires and fleshly lusts.(no content)The Greek word for self-control in Galatians 5:23 is &quot;egkrateia&quot; which means &quot;temperance: the virtue of one who masters his desires and passions, especially his sensual appetites.&quot;

## Self-Control and Spiritual Training

Classic spiritual disciplines, such as prayer, solitude, fasting, Sabbath, Bible memorization and meditation, serving, and tithing—when practiced regularly—can orient our lives around God&#x27;s love and grace rather than our own ambitions and desires, and these positive habits keep us open to the Holy Spirit&#x27;s transforming work and train us in the sacrificial living that Jesus perfectly embodied.(no content)God&#x27;s Holy Spirit that lives inside of each believer is the One who is really giving us the power to have self-control.</pre>

            <div class="thinking-text">Good, now I have a good collection of verses. Let me compile the recommendations for the Discipline section.

Current verses:
- Proverbs 27:17 - &quot;As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.&quot;
- 1 Corinthians 9:27 - &quot;But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified.&quot;
- Hebrews 12:11 - &quot;For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.&quot;

Good verses found:
1. Proverbs 25:28 - &quot;A man without self-control is like a city broken into and left without walls.&quot;
2. Proverbs 12:1 - &quot;He who loves correction loves knowledge, but he who hates reproof is stupid.&quot;
3. Proverbs 13:18 - &quot;Poverty and disgrace come to him who ignores instruction, but whoever heeds reproof is honored.&quot;
4. 2 Timothy 1:7 - &quot;For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline.&quot;
5. 1 Corinthians 9:24-27 - (already have 9:27, could expand to include the athletic training context)
6. Galatians 5:22-23 - &quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.&quot;

I think the strongest additions would be:
1. Proverbs 25:28 - vivid image of city without walls
2. 2 Timothy 1:7 - God gives self-discipline
3. Proverbs 12:1 - about loving correction/discipline


I&#x27;ll prepare a concise presentation highlighting these key biblical insights on discipline, selecting verses that powerfully illustrate the importance of self-control and personal growth.</div>

        <div class='content'><p>Based on my search, here are recommendations for the Discipline section:</p>
<h2>Current Verses (All Solid)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Proverbs 27:17 - Iron sharpens iron</li>
<li>1 Corinthians 9:27 - Disciplining the body</li>
<li>Hebrews 12:11 - Discipline yields peaceful fruit</li>
</ul>
<h2>Strong Recommendations to ADD:</h2>
<p><strong>TOP PICKS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Proverbs 25:28</strong> - &quot;A man without self-control is like a city broken into and left without walls.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Why</em>: Vivid, memorable image of vulnerability without discipline</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>2 Timothy 1:7</strong> - &quot;For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Why</em>: Frames self-discipline as a gift from God, not just willpower</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Galatians 5:22-23</strong> - &quot;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Why</em>: Positions self-control as a spiritual fruit, not just personal effort</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ALSO GOOD:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Proverbs 12:1</strong> - &quot;Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but he who hates reproof is stupid.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Why</em>: Strong statement about accepting correction (though &quot;stupid&quot; is blunt)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Proverbs 13:18</strong> - &quot;Poverty and disgrace come to him who ignores instruction, but whoever heeds reproof is honored.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Why</em>: Shows consequences of rejecting discipline</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My recommendation</strong>: Add Proverbs 25:28 (memorable image), 2 Timothy 1:7 (God gives discipline), and either Galatians 5:22-23 (spiritual fruit) or Proverbs 12:1 (loving correction).</p>

The section now has 5 verses total, with good progression from the foundational importance of discipline (25:28, 12:1) to mutual sharpening (27:17) to personal application (1 Cor 9:27, Hebrews 12:11).</div>

I&#x27;ve found comprehensive information about Bible verses on work, diligence, and effort. Here are the key findings:

## Colossians 3:23

Colossians 3:23 states: &quot;Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters.&quot;(no content)This verse tells us to work with all of our hearts, no matter what we are doing, as though we are &quot;working for the Lord&quot; and not for humans, reminding us to persist as though we are serving God and not man.

## Proverbs Verses on Diligence vs. Laziness

The book of Proverbs contains numerous verses contrasting diligence with laziness:

**Proverbs 13:4**: Lazy people want much but get little, but those who work hard will prosper.

**Proverbs 10:4**: Lazy hands make for poverty, but diligent hands bring wealth.

**Proverbs 14:23**: All hard work brings a profit, but mere talk leads only to poverty.

**Proverbs 12:24**: Work hard and become a leader; be lazy and become a slave.

**Proverbs 21:5**: Good planning and hard work lead to prosperity, but hasty shortcuts lead to poverty.

**Proverbs 6:6-11**: Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider its ways and be wise! It has no commander, no overseer or ruler, yet it stores its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest.

## Other Notable Verses

2 Thessalonians 3:10: &quot;Even while we were with you, we gave you this command: &#x27;Those unwilling to work will not get to eat.&#x27;&quot;(no content)God&#x27;s Word makes it very clear that we are instructed to work hard and put our best effort forward, with the Bible, especially in the wisdom-filled book of Proverbs, speaking often of the cause and effect relationship of hard work and rewards as well as laziness and ruin.</pre>

I&#x27;ve found comprehensive information about the Parable of the Talents from Matthew 25:14-30. Here are the key findings:

## The Parable Overview

The parable tells of a master who was leaving on a journey and entrusted his property to his servants. According to the abilities of each man, one slave received five talents, the second received two, and the third received only one.(no content)Two of the servants earned 100 percent returns by trading with the funds, but the third servant hid the money in the ground and earned nothing.

## &quot;Well Done, Good and Faithful Servant&quot;

The famous phrase appears when the master returns. The first and second slaves explain that they each put their talents to work and have doubled the value; each slave was rewarded: &quot;His master said to him, &#x27;Well done, good and trustworthy slave; you have been trustworthy in a few things, I will put you in charge of many things; enter into the joy of your master.&#x27;&quot;(no content)The master praises the two trustworthy servants with the words, &quot;Well done, good and trustworthy slave&quot; (Matthew 25:23), showing that the master cares about the results (&quot;well done&quot;), the methods (&quot;good&quot;), and the motivation (&quot;trustworthy&quot;).

## Themes of Stewardship and Faithfulness

Traditionally, the parable of the talents has been seen as an exhortation to Jesus&#x27; disciples to use their God-given gifts in the service of God, and to take risks for the sake of the Kingdom of God.(no content)God has given each person a wide variety of gifts, and he expects us to employ those gifts in his service. It is not acceptable merely to put those gifts on a closet shelf and ignore them.(no content)The parable impresses on disciples the weight of their responsibility as stewards to care for His kingdom and the serious consequences of neglecting to understand and apply His instructions.</pre>

I&#x27;ve completed the web search for your query about these Bible verses. Here are the results:

## James 2:17 - &quot;Faith Without Works Is Dead&quot;

James 2:17 states: &quot;Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.&quot; This verse is part of a larger passage (James 2:14-26) that discusses the relationship between faith and works.

Faith without works is described as a dead faith because the lack of works reveals an unchanged life or a spiritually dead heart.(no content)James is not saying that our works make us righteous before God but that real saving faith is demonstrated by good works - works are not the cause of salvation; works are the evidence of salvation.(no content)The phrase &quot;faith without works is dead&quot; means that when faith isn&#x27;t accompanied by real actions rooted in love for God and others, it is useless.

## Proverbs 16:3 - &quot;Commit Your Work to the Lord&quot;

Proverbs 16:3 reads: &quot;Commit your works to the LORD and your plans will be achieved.&quot; (This verse appears in various translations with slightly different wording.)

The statement &quot;commit to the LORD whatever you do&quot; literally means &quot;roll your works on the LORD,&quot; depicting a person who transfers a burden from their own back to one stronger and better able to bear it.(no content)The best chance for success comes when plans are aligned with truth, meaning those who submit to God&#x27;s will and seek Him are in a better position than those who ignore or reject Him.</pre>

            <div class="thinking-text">Perfect! Now I have a good collection of verses. Let me compile my recommendations for the &quot;Do the work&quot; section. The current verses are:
- Ecclesiastes 9:10 - Do everything with all your might
- Proverbs 21:31 - Prepare the horse but victory is the Lord&#x27;s
- 2 Thessalonians 3:10 - Unwilling to work shall not eat

New verses to consider:
- Colossians 3:23 - Work as for the Lord
- Proverbs 13:4 - Lazy want much but get little
- Proverbs 10:4 - Diligent hands bring wealth
- Proverbs 14:23 - All hard work brings profit
- Matthew 25:23 - Well done good and faithful servant
- James 2:17 - Faith without works is dead
- Proverbs 16:3 - Commit your works to the Lord

I think the best additions would be:
1. Colossians 3:23 - Working as for the Lord (shifts perspective)
2. Proverbs 13:4 or 10:4 - Concrete contrast between lazy and diligent
3. James 2:17 - Faith requires action
4. Proverbs 16:3 - Commit work to God (balances with Proverbs 21:31 already there)

Let me present these to the user.</div>

            <div class="thinking-text">Great! I&#x27;ve successfully added all four verses. Now the &quot;Do the work&quot; section has a nice flow:

1. Colossians 3:23 - Work as for the Lord (motivation)
2. Proverbs 13:4 - Lazy vs. diligent contrast
3. James 2:17 - Faith without works is dead (connects belief and action)
4. Proverbs 16:3 - Commit your works to God (trust + effort)
5. Then the original three verses

This creates a strong section that covers:
- Working for God&#x27;s glory
- The importance of diligence
- Faith requiring action
- Committing work to God
- Doing everything with all your might
- Preparing but trusting God for victory
- The necessity of work

The James 2:17 verse is particularly good for the religion post because it directly connects to the larger theme of &quot;Belief vs Practice&quot; from the Appendix section.</div>

<li><strong>Proverbs 13:4</strong> - Lazy vs. diligent contrast</li>
<li><strong>James 2:17</strong> - Faith without works is dead (perfect for your belief vs. practice theme!)</li>
<li><strong>Proverbs 16:3</strong> - Commit your works to God (pairs nicely with your existing Proverbs 21:31)</li>
</ol>
<p>Then flows into your original three verses. The James 2:17 addition is particularly strong for this post since it directly speaks to your larger theme about practice being essential, not just belief.</p>

            <div class="thinking-text">The user has made manual changes to the religion.md file. Let me see what changed:

1. TOC was updated - the sections were reorganized as subsections under &quot;Some bible verses I really like&quot;
2. Section headers were renamed:
   - &quot;Tolerance&quot; → &quot;Be Tolerant Of oThers&quot; (with a typo: &quot;oThers&quot; instead of &quot;Others&quot;)
   - &quot;Discipline&quot; → &quot;Be Deliberate, Disciplined, Daily&quot;
3. Some verses were removed/moved to a new section called &quot;Others I need to categorize&quot;
4. The verse ordering appears to have changed

Let me first review these changes by reading the current file to see exactly what&#x27;s there, then I should:
1. Read the file to review changes
2. Check for any issues (like the typo)
3. Run pre-commit checks
4. Create a commit

   159→## Some bible verses I really like
   160→
   161→While I struggle with literal belief, I&#x27;ve found certain verses capture truths about how to live well. They&#x27;re less about theology and more about practical wisdom - the kind that holds up whether you believe in God or not.
   162→
   163→#### Don&#x27;t take Faith Blindly
   164→
   165→- 1 John 4:1 - &quot;Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.&quot;
   166→- Proverbs 14:15 - &quot;The simple believes everything, but the prudent gives thought to his steps.&quot;
   167→- 1 Thessalonians 5:21 - &quot;But test everything; hold fast what is good.&quot;
   168→- 2 Corinthians 13:5 - &quot;Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves.&quot;
   169→
   170→#### Be Tolerant Of oThers
   171→
   172→- Matthew 7:1 - &quot;Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you.&quot;
   173→- Matthew 7:12 - &quot;So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.&quot;
   174→- Galatians 3:28 - &quot;There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.&quot;
   175→- Romans 14:10 - &quot;You, then, why do you judge your brother or sister? Or why do you treat them with contempt? For we will all stand before God&#x27;s judgment seat.&quot;
   176→- Romans 14:13 - &quot;Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister.&quot;
   177→
   178→#### Be Deliberate, Disciplined, Daily
   179→
   180→- Proverbs 25:28 - &quot;A man without self-control is like a city broken into and left without walls.&quot;
   181→- 1 Corinthians 9:27 - &quot;But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified.&quot;
   182→- Hebrews 12:11 - &quot;For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.&quot;
   183→
   184→#### Do the work
   185→
   186→- Colossians 3:23 - &quot;Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters.&quot;

   188→- 2 Thessalonians 3:10 - &quot;For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: &#x27;The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.&#x27;&quot;
   189→
   190→
   191→### Others I need to categorize
   192→
   193→- Proverbs 27:17 - &quot;As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.&quot;
   194→
   195→## Appendix and stuff I&#x27;m working in ...
   196→
   197→### Why Religion?
   198→
   199→Religions persist because they solve hard coordination problems: transmitting values across generations, creating social trust, and providing meaning under uncertainty. They encode “do this, not that” as embodied wisdom, not just abstract rules. My interest is pragmatic: learn from what works, name what harms, keep the parts that build resilient, prosocial humans.

3. Many verses were removed/consolidated - now only 3 verses per section instead of the full list we added
4. New &quot;Others I need to categorize&quot; section with verses that didn&#x27;t fit

1. Fix the typo in &quot;oThers&quot; → &quot;Others&quot;
2. Run git diff to show what changed

4. Commit the changes

 While I struggle with literal belief, I&#x27;ve found certain verses capture truths about how to live well. They&#x27;re less about theology and more about practical wisdom - the kind that holds up whether you believe in God or not.
 
-#### Tolerance
+#### Don&#x27;t take Faith Blindly
 
+- 1 John 4:1 - &quot;Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.&quot;
+- Proverbs 14:15 - &quot;The simple believes everything, but the prudent gives thought to his steps.&quot;
+- 1 Thessalonians 5:21 - &quot;But test everything; hold fast what is good.&quot;
+- 2 Corinthians 13:5 - &quot;Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves.&quot;
+
+#### Be Tolerant Of Others
+
+- Matthew 7:1 - &quot;Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you.&quot;
+- Matthew 7:12 - &quot;So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.&quot;
+- Galatians 3:28 - &quot;There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.&quot;
 - Romans 14:10 - &quot;You, then, why do you judge your brother or sister? Or why do you treat them with contempt? For we will all stand before God&#x27;s judgment seat.&quot;
 - Romans 14:13 - &quot;Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister.&quot;
 
-#### Discipline
+#### Be Deliberate, Disciplined, Daily
 
-- Proverbs 27:17 - &quot;As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.&quot;
+- Proverbs 25:28 - &quot;A man without self-control is like a city broken into and left without walls.&quot;
 - 1 Corinthians 9:27 - &quot;But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified.&quot;
 - Hebrews 12:11 - &quot;For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.&quot;
 
-#### You don&#x27;t have control, but you must still do the work
+#### Do the work
 
-- Ecclesiastes 9:10 - &quot;Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the realm of the dead, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.&quot;
-- Proverbs 21:31 - &quot;The horse is made ready for the day of battle, but victory rests with the Lord.&quot;
+- Colossians 3:23 - &quot;Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters.&quot;
+- Proverbs 13:4 - &quot;Lazy people want much but get little, but those who work hard will prosper.&quot;
 - 2 Thessalonians 3:10 - &quot;For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: &#x27;The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.&#x27;&quot;
 
+
+### Others I need to categorize
+
+- Proverbs 27:17 - &quot;As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.&quot;

4. **New section**: &quot;Others I need to categorize&quot; for verses that didn&#x27;t fit the main themes

The changes look good. The user consolidated to the strongest verses in each category. Now I need to run pre-commit checks and then commit.</div>

    Add Bible verses section with practical wisdom themes
    
    Added new &quot;Some bible verses I really like&quot; section with four themed
    subsections focusing on practical wisdom rather than theology:
    
    - Don&#x27;t take Faith Blindly: verses about testing teachings and seeking wisdom
      (1 John 4:1, Proverbs 14:15, 1 Thessalonians 5:21, 2 Corinthians 13:5)
    
    - Be Tolerant Of Others: verses on not judging and treating all equally
      (Matthew 7:1, 7:12, Galatians 3:28, Romans 14:10, 14:13)
    
    - Be Deliberate, Disciplined, Daily: verses on self-control and discipline
      (Proverbs 25:28, 1 Corinthians 9:27, Hebrews 12:11)
    
    - Do the work: verses on diligence and effort
      (Colossians 3:23, Proverbs 13:4, 2 Thessalonians 3:10)
    
    Each section curated to strongest 3-5 verses that resonate with engineering
    mindset and address concerns raised earlier about arbitrariness and literalism.
    Also added &quot;Others I need to categorize&quot; section for future organization.
    
    Updated backlinks.json (doc_size: 30k → 31k).
