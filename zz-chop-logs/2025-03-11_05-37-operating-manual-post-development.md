## Operating Manual Post Development (3/11/2025, 5:37:24 AM)

_**User**_

Lets work on my operating manual post, start by reading in all content @operating-manual-2.md , and all blog post conventions

I'll help you work on your operating manual post. Let's start by reading the content of your operating manual and understanding the blog post conventions.

Now let's fetch the blog post conventions to understand how to properly format and structure your blog content:

Now let's also fetch the blog writing style rule to understand the tone and style requirements:

Based on the content I've read, I now have a good understanding of your operating manual post and the blog post conventions. Let me analyze what I see and suggest some improvements:

## Analysis of Your Operating Manual Post

Your operating manual is a comprehensive personal guide that covers various aspects of your life, including:

1. Morning and evening routines
2. Calendar management
3. Personal strengths and weaknesses
4. Health and habits
5. Family roles
6. Cognitive reframing techniques
7. Triggers and mental challenges

The post has a good structure with a clear table of contents, but there are several sections that could be expanded or improved:

1. Some sections like "Technical Depth and Breadth," "Technical Best Practice," "Bean counting," etc. are just headers without content
2. The "Husband" and "Father" sections under Family are empty
3. There's a TODO note about splitting the post
4. Some typos exist (e.g., "aspiration an systems" instead of "aspiration and systems")
5. The post uses summarize-page includes extensively, which is good according to conventions

## Suggested Improvements

Let me outline some improvements we could make to enhance your operating manual post:

1. **Fix typos and grammar issues**
2. **Complete empty sections** with meaningful content
3. **Update formatting** to align with blog conventions
4. **Enhance the introduction** to better explain the purpose of an operating manual
5. **Consider the TODO** about splitting the post
6. **Update any outdated information** (e.g., children's ages)

Would you like me to start implementing these improvements? I can begin with fixing typos and grammar issues, then move on to suggesting content for the empty sections.

I'll start by fixing the grammar and spelling issues in your operating manual post. Let me make these corrections:

Great! I've completed the grammar and spelling fixes throughout your operating manual post. Here's a summary of the changes made:

1. Fixed typos and grammatical errors throughout the document
2. Corrected inconsistent capitalization in section headings
3. Updated the table of contents to match the corrected headings
4. Improved punctuation and sentence structure
5. Fixed formatting issues with lists
6. Standardized terminology (e.g., "Coronavirus" instead of "Corona Virus")
7. Corrected word spacing and paragraph formatting

The document now has a more consistent and professional appearance. Would you like me to continue with other improvements, such as:

1. Filling in the empty sections (like "Technical Depth and Breadth", "Bean counting", etc.)?
2. Updating any outdated information (like children's ages if they've changed)?
3. Enhancing the introduction to better explain the purpose of an operating manual?
4. Addressing the TODO note about splitting the post?

Let me know which aspects you'd like to focus on next.

I apologize for my assumption. Could you please clarify what you mean by "shot it"? Do you want to:

2. Take a shot at improving it?
3. Something else?

Please let me know what specifically you'd like me to do with the Morning Routine section, and I'll be happy to help.

_**User**_

dont' shorten, show it here

_**Assistant**_

Ah, here's the Morning Routine section from your operating manual:

```12:89:_d/operating-manual-2.md
## Morning Routine

At my best, I roll out of bed either when my eyes open or at 5am, whatever comes first. Then I sit in front of my [mood lamp](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PCN4UVU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and drink my cold brew nitro coffee.

_Ah when the kids were younger - I also loved getting my morning hug from my kids, but now that Zach's older (9), I'm down to just getting the hugs from Amelia - who is 5._

### Weekend morning routine

On the weekends, the gym opens at 8, so it's essential I drink my coffee in my home office chair so I can work on whatever is most important to me, often reading or writing. At 7:30 it's time to drag my butt to the gym.

Post gym I'll either hit the coffee shop to do some more writing, or head home to spend the day with my family.

### Weekday morning routine

At my best, I roll out of bed either when my eyes open or at 5am, whatever comes first.

The gym opens at 5:30, and I try to be there by 6.

**Walking kids to school** has been one of my most cherished morning activities. Whether it's a block away or to the bus stop, these 10-minute walks have consistently been a major quality of life improvement. The kids really appreciate it, and it's amazing how this small investment of time can have such an impact on my relationship with my family.

**2022:** After my workout, I go to work so I'm done at 4pm.

**Pre - 2021:** After my workout, I often chillax with my next priority being walking kids to school. Walking the kids to school has surprisingly been a major quality of life improvement for a very small impact to my day.

### Morning Kryptonite

I have three common failure modes in my morning routine:

- Starting my day by sitting in my easy chair drinking my coffee. This mindless activity has me skipping those things that are important to me.
- Hitting snooze when my alarm goes off. The worst of all worlds, not sleeping, and not being up and doing stuff.
- Lying in bed awake when I wake up before 5. Sometimes I wake up and can't fall back asleep @ 3 or 4 (which isn't crazy because sometimes I go to bed @ 7 or 8). Similar to hitting snooze, I'm not sleeping, and I'm not accomplishing anything.

### Morning Refreshers

Instead of thinking about working out as a chore, I reframe it as a refresher - a way to energize and reset myself. I have different levels of refreshers:

- **Refresher**: [Training at the gym](/physical-health) - the foundation of feeling energized and ready for the day
- **Refresher Plus**: Training at the gym followed by quality time at the coffee shop - combining physical energy with mental space
- **Refresher Supreme**: The ultimate morning reset - coffee shop time, gym training, and [meditation](/siy) - nurturing body, mind, and spirit

_Note: The coffee shop represents a mental state - focused, relaxed, and ready to think deeply. While I currently need the physical coffee shop to enter this state, I'm working on being able to deliberately enter this state anywhere._

### Daily Journaling

My morning coffee shop time is when I do my [daily journaling](/process-journal). This practice helps me process my thoughts, set intentions for the day, and maintain mental clarity.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/process-journal" %}
```

This section covers your complete morning routine, including:
1. Wake-up routine
2. Weekend vs weekday differences
3. Common failure modes (Kryptonite)
4. Refresher activities
5. Daily journaling practice
6. Historical notes about walking kids to school

Would you like me to analyze any particular aspect of this section or make specific improvements?

Making walking kids to school the 2024, update 2025:

Now that Zach is in high school, I walk him to the bus stop. I used to also walk Amelia tot he bustop, but I ralized I could actually drive her to school and that adds 5 minutes. With Tony (add link) its' zero stress on me, and I get an extra 10 minutes with Amelia

_****_

I've updated the section to include both the 2024 and 2025 changes to your morning routine with the kids. I've maintained the chronological order (newest to oldest) and kept the historical context. I also added the link to Tony as requested.

The progression now shows how your routine has evolved over the years, from the pre-2021 period through to the current 2025 arrangement, where you've optimized the routine to get quality time with both kids in different ways - walking with Zach and driving with Amelia.

Would you like me to make any other adjustments to this section?
