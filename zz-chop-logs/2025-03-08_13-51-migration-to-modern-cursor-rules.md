## Migration to Modern Cursor Rules (3/8/2025, 1:51:54 PM)

_**User**_

Usee all the rules  @000-cursor-rule-creation.mdc to migrate from @.cursorrules  to modern rules (e.g. /.cursor/rules)

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you migrate from the .cursorrules file to modern Cursor rules in the .cursor/rules directory. First, let me understand the current structure and then create the appropriate rule files.

Great, I can see the .cursor/rules directory exists. Let's check if there are any existing rules in it:

Let me read the rest of the file:

Based on the content of the .cursorrules file and the format of the existing rules, I'll now create the necessary rule files. I'll follow the process outlined in the 000-cursor-rule-creation.mdc file.

Let's start by creating a temporary file for each section of the .cursorrules file that needs to be migrated. I'll focus on the sections that don't already have corresponding rule files.

First, let's check if we need to create a rule for "Adding Images to Blog Posts":

I see that most of the rules from the .cursorrules file have already been migrated to the modern format in the .cursor/rules directory. Let's check if there are any sections in the .cursorrules file that don't have corresponding rule files.

Let's check if there's a rule for "Terminal Command Conventions":

Based on my analysis, I need to create the following new rule files:

1. 109-terminal-commands.mdc - Terminal Command Conventions
2. 110-permalink-management.mdc - Changing Permalinks
3. 111-link-conventions.mdc - Link Conventions
4. 112-summarize-page-includes.mdc - Using summarize-page Includes
5. 113-alert-includes.mdc - Using Alert Includes

Let's create these files following the process outlined in the 000-cursor-rule-creation.mdc file.

First, let's create a temporary file for the Terminal Command Conventions rule:

---

_****_

```bash
touch temp-terminal-commands.md
```

```

❯
```

Now, let's edit the temporary file with the Terminal Command Conventions rule:

---

+ description: ALWAYS append | /bin/cat to commands that use pagers or require user interaction to prevent command breakage

+ priority: 2
+ version: 1.0.0
+ ---
+ 
+ # Terminal Command Conventions
+ 
+ <version>1.0.0</version>
+ 
+ ## Context
+ - When running terminal commands in scripts or through Cursor
+ - When working with commands that use pagers or require user interaction
+ - When running long-running commands that should continue in the background
+ 
+ ## Rule Details
+ 
+ ### Pager Commands
+ 
+ For ANY commands that would use a pager or require user interaction, you should append ` | /bin/cat` to the command (NOT just `cat` as it's aliased to `bat`). Otherwise, the command will break.
+ 
+ This applies to the following commands:
+ - git
+ - less
+ - head
+ - tail
+ - more
+ - man
+ - Any other command that would normally open a pager
+ 
+ #### Examples
+ 
+ <example>
+ # Good: Appending | /bin/cat to commands with pagers
+ git log | /bin/cat
+ git diff | /bin/cat
+ less file.txt | /bin/cat
+ head -n 100 large_file.txt | /bin/cat
+ </example>
+ 
+ <example type="invalid">
+ # Bad: Not appending | /bin/cat to commands with pagers
+ git log
+ git diff
+ less file.txt
+ head -n 100 large_file.txt
+ </example>
+ 
+ ### Background Commands
+ 
+ For commands that are long running or expected to run indefinitely until interruption, run them in the background by:
+ 1. Adding `&` at the end of the command
+ 2. Setting `is_background` to true when using the run_terminal_cmd tool
+ 
+ #### Examples
+ 
+ <example>
+ # Good: Running long-running commands in the background
+ npm start &
+ python server.py &
+ </example>
+ 
+ ## Coding Style Preferences
+ 
+ 1. Prefer returning from a function vs nesting ifs
+ 2. Prefer descriptive variable names over comments
+ 
```

Let's create a temporary file for the Permalink Management rule:

---

_****_

```bash

+ # Permalink Management
+ 
+ <version>1.0.0</version>
+ 
+ ## Context
+ - When changing a post's permalink
+ - When restructuring blog content
+ - When moving content to a new URL
+ 
+ ## Rule Details
+ 
+ When changing a post's permalink:
+ 
+ 1. Use the `redirect_from` front matter to maintain compatibility
+ 2. This ensures old links continue to work
+ 3. IMPORTANT: Do not use 'aliases' in front matter - it doesn't work
+ 
+ ### Correct Format
+ 
+ ```yaml
+ ---
+ permalink: /new-url
+ redirect_from:
+   - /old-url # ✅ correct way
+ ---
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Incorrect Format
+ 
+ ```yaml
+ ---
+ permalink: /new-url
+ aliases: ["/old-url"] # ❌ wrong way - doesn't work
+ ---
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Additional Steps
+ 
+ 1. Check existing links to the post in other content and update if needed
+ 2. The redirects are handled by Jekyll, no need to modify back-links.json
+ 
+ ## Examples
+ 
+ <example>
+ # Good: Using redirect_from for permalink changes
+ ---
+ title: "My Blog Post"
+ permalink: /new-post-url
+ redirect_from:
+   - /old-post-url
+   - /another-old-url
+ ---
+ </example>
+ 
+ <example type="invalid">
+ # Bad: Using aliases instead of redirect_from
+ ---
+ title: "My Blog Post"
+ permalink: /new-post-url
+ aliases: ["/old-post-url", "/another-old-url"]
+ ---
+ </example>
+ 
+ ## Reference Example
+ 
+ See `_posts/2018-01-01-fuck-pride.md` for a good example of permalink redirection.

+ # Link Conventions
+ 
+ <version>1.0.0</version>
+ 
+ ## Context
+ - When adding internal links in markdown documents
+ - When referencing other blog posts or pages
+ - When creating navigation between related content
+ 
+ ## Rule Details
+ 
+ When adding links in markdown documents:
+ 
+ 1. Always check `back-links.json` to find the correct redirect URL
+ 2. Use the format `[visible text](/redirect-url)`
+ 3. Never use relative paths for internal links
+ 
+ ### Steps to Find Correct URLs
+ 
+ 1. Check `back-links.json` for the correct permalink
+ 2. Use the permalink as the link URL, not the filename
+ 3. Ensure the URL starts with a forward slash
+ 
+ ## Examples
+ 
+ <example>
+ # Good: Using correct redirect URLs from back-links.json
+ [meditation](/siy)
+ [productivity](/productivity)
+ [technical skills](/technical-skills)
+ </example>
+ 
+ <example type="invalid">
+ # Bad: Using incorrect or non-redirect URLs
+ [meditation](/meditation)  # Wrong: should be /siy
+ [productivity](productivity.md)  # Wrong: using filename instead of permalink
+ [technical skills](../technical-skills)  # Wrong: using relative path
+ </example>
+ 
+ ## Common Redirects
+ 
+ Some common redirects to be aware of:
+ - Meditation content: use `/siy` instead of `/meditation`
+ - Technical skills: use `/technical-skills` instead of `/tech`
+ - Management: use `/management` instead of `/managing`
+ 
```

+ ---
+ 
+ # Using summarize-page Includes
+ 
+ <version>1.0.0</version>
+ 
+ ## Context
+ - When including a summary of another page's content
+ - When referencing related topics
+ - When creating cross-references between blog posts
+ 
+ ## Rule Details
+ 
+ When you want to include a summary of another page's content:
+ 
+ 1. Use the `summarize-page` include with the format:
+    ```markdown
+    {% include summarize-page.html src="/page-url" %}
+    ```
+ 
+ 2. Before adding the include:
+    - Always check `back-links.json` to confirm the correct permalink
+    - The src should match the permalink, not the filename
+    - Example: Use `/siy` for meditation content, not `/meditation`
+ 
+ 3. The include will automatically:
+    - Pull in the description from the target page
+    - Add a link attribution to the source
+    - Format it with proper styling
+ 
+ ## Usage Patterns
+ 
+ Common usage patterns:
+ - After introducing a concept that's detailed elsewhere
+ - When listing related topics
+ - In sections that reference other content
+ 
+ ## Examples
+ 
+ <example>
+ # Good: Using summarize-page with correct permalinks
+ **Affirmations**
+ Reinforcing positive beliefs and mindsets I want to cultivate.
+ 
+ {% include summarize-page.html src="/affirmations" %}
+ 
+ **Meditation**
+ My practice for mental clarity and focus.
+ 
+ {% include summarize-page.html src="/siy" %}
+ </example>
+ 
+ <example type="invalid">
+ # Bad: Using incorrect permalinks
+ **Meditation**
+ My practice for mental clarity and focus.
+ 
+ {% include summarize-page.html src="/meditation" %}  # Wrong: should be /siy
+ </example>
+ 
+ ## Formatting
+ 
+ - Ensure there's a blank line before and after the include
+ - Place the include near relevant content
+ - Use a brief introduction before the include to provide context
+ 
```

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you merge all these rules into a single comprehensive blog_editing_conventions rule file. This will consolidate the various blog editing conventions into one place for easier reference.

Let's create a temporary file for the merged blog editing conventions:

+ 
+ ## Context

+ - When formatting content for readability and consistency
+ 
+ ## Terminal Command Conventions

+ - Technical skills: use `/technical-skills` instead of `/tech`
+ - Management: use `/management` instead of `/managing`
+ 
+ ## Using summarize-page Includes
+ 
+ When you want to include a summary of another page's content:
+ 
+ 1. Use the `summarize-page` include with the format:
+    ```markdown
+    {% include summarize-page.html src="/page-url" %}

+ - In sections that reference other content
+ 
+ ### Formatting
+ 
+ - Ensure there's a blank line before and after the include
+ - Place the include near relevant content
+ - Use a brief introduction before the include to provide context
+ 
+ ## Table of Contents Management
+ 
+ When modifying markdown headings:
+ 
+ 1. Always update the Table of Contents (TOC)
+ 2. The TOC is managed by vim-markdown-toc
+ 3. For new posts: Place TOC immediately after the first paragraph
+ 4. For existing posts: Don't move the TOC location
+ 5. Keep the special markers intact:
+ 
+ ```markdown
+ <!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
+ <!-- vim-markdown-toc-start -->
+ [TOC content]
+ <!-- vim-markdown-toc-end -->
+ <!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
+ ```
+ 
+ ## List Replacements in Tables
+ 
+ When using lists that should be inserted into tables:
+ 
+ 1. In the table, use the format `[lXX](lXX)` where:
+    - The link text and href must both match exactly (e.g., `[l31](l31)`)
+    - XX is the list number (e.g., 31, 32, etc.)
+    - **IMPORTANT**: List numbers must be unique across the entire file
+    - If adding a new list, check existing lists in the file and use a new unique number
+ 
+ 2. Below the table, structure the lists like this:
+    ```markdown
+    <div/>
+ 
+    - lXX
+    - List item 1
+    - List item 2
+ 
+    <div/>
+    ```
+ 
+ 3. Important formatting rules:
+    - Each list must start with `<div/>`
+    - First list item must be the list identifier (e.g., `l31`)
+    - List must end with `<div/>`
+    - The list identifier in the table link must match exactly
+    - Never reuse list numbers within the same file
+ 
+ ## Using Alert Includes
+ 
+ When you want to add an alert box to your content:
+ 
+ 1. Use the `alert` include with the format:
+    ```markdown
+    {% include alert.html content="Your alert message here" style="info" %}
+    ```
+ 
+ 2. Available styles:
+    - `primary` - Blue, used for primary actions/information
+    - `secondary` - Gray, used for secondary information
+    - `success` - Green, used for success messages
+    - `danger` - Red, used for error messages or dangerous actions
+    - `warning` - Yellow, used for warning messages
+    - `info` - Light blue (default), used for informational messages
+    - `light` - Very light gray, used for subtle alerts
+    - `dark` - Dark gray, used for high-contrast alerts
+ 
+ 3. Best practices:
+    - Use alerts sparingly to maintain their impact
+    - Choose appropriate styles for the message context
+    - Keep alert messages concise and clear
+    - Place alerts near the relevant content they reference
+ 
+ ## Writing Style and Formatting
+ 
+ 1. **No Emojis**
+    - Do not use emojis in blog posts or documentation
+    - This includes titles, headers, and content
+    - Keep the writing style clean and professional
+ 
+ 2. **Style Guidelines**
+    - Fun and quirky
+    - Technical, but not boring
+    - Prefer descriptive variable names over comments
+    - Prefer returning from a function vs nesting ifs
+ 
+ ## Opening Blog Posts During Development
+ 
+ When working on a blog post:
+ 
+ 1. Get the permalink from the post's front matter
+ 2. Use this command to open the post in the default browser:
+    ```bash
+    open http://localhost:4000{permalink}

Perfect! I've successfully created a comprehensive blog editing conventions rule file that merges all the individual rules. Here's a summary of what I've done:

1. Created a new rule file called `120-blog-editing-conventions.mdc` that combines:
   - Terminal Command Conventions
   - Permalink Management
   - Link Conventions
   - Summarize Page Includes
   - Table of Contents Management
   - List Replacements in Tables
   - Alert Includes
   - Writing Style and Formatting
   - Opening Blog Posts During Development

2. The merged file follows the standard Cursor rule format with:
   - Proper frontmatter (description, globs, tags, priority, version)
   - Clear section headers
   - Examples and best practices
   - Consistent formatting

3. I've cleaned up all the temporary files used during the process.

The new merged rule provides a single comprehensive reference for all blog editing conventions, making it easier to follow consistent practices when editing blog content. The rule is now available in the `.cursor/rules` directory and will be applied when working with blog content.

Would you like me to make any additional changes to the merged rule file or help with any other aspects of the migration?

Have we covered everything in .cursorules and conventions.md can we erase them, or is there other stuff to bring over?

Let me check if we've covered everything from the .cursorrules file and if there's a conventions.md file that we need to review as well.
