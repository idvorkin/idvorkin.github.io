Based on the search results, I can see that you have a blog post about failure at the permalink `/fail`. Let me check the content of this file to get more details.

I found your blog post about failure. It's titled "Failure is not an option it is a necassity" and is located at the permalink `/fail` (with a redirect from `/failure`). Let me help you view it in your local development environment.

Let's first check if your Jekyll server is running:

_**User**_

That's running open the post locally

_**Assistant**_

I'll open the failure blog post locally for you.

---

_****_

```bash
open http://localhost:4000/fail
```

```


```

---

_****_

The failure blog post should now be open in your default browser at http://localhost:4000/fail. This post discusses how failure is a necessity rather than something to be avoided, with sections covering:

1. General thoughts on failure and good sayings
2. Smart people talking about fear of failure (including insights from James Webb Telescope team, Elon Musk, and DHH)
3. Handling failures that are within vs. outside our control
4. Related reading on anxiety and anxiety management

Is there anything specific about this blog post you'd like to discuss or modify?

I've fixed the main typo in the title, changing "necassity" to "necessity" and adding a comma for better readability. The rest of the content looks grammatically sound. 

Let me check if there are any other issues in the file that need to be addressed:

_**Assistant**_

I apologize for the misunderstanding. Let me go through the entire file and point out any issues or improvements that could be made without making edits yet:

1. **Title**: You've already fixed the main typo, changing "necassity" to "necessity" and adding a comma.

2. **COEs section**: The sentence "Failures are a great opportunity to learn.

_**User**_

Just spelling and grammer

_**Assistant**_

I'll focus only on spelling and grammar issues in the file. Let me go through the entire document and identify any spelling or grammar problems:

---

_****_

After reviewing the entire file, I don't see any additional spelling or grammar issues that need to be fixed. The main correction was already made to the title, changing "necassity" to "necessity" and adding a comma for better readability.

The content appears to be grammatically sound throughout. The numbered list in the "Out of our control, vs in our control failures" section is formatted correctly, and the quotes and examples are well-structured.

Is there any specific part of the document where you think there might be spelling or grammar issues that I should look at more closely?

Update introp aragraph to include this

Failure is not an option it’s a requirement.  Failure not a person but an event.  You learn how to move on. Learn why it failed and judge. Can’t grow with out failing. Can’t beat yourself up

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the introduction paragraph to include the additional content you provided while maintaining good grammar and style.

---

_****_

_****_

Let me try again with a more specific edit to update the introduction paragraph:

---

_****_

```diff
  ---
  
- Failure is not an option; it's a necessity. Here are some thoughts on failures.
+ Failure is not an option; it's a necessity. Failure is not an option; it's a requirement. Failure is not a person but an event. You learn how to move on, learn why it failed, and make judgments. You can't grow without failing, and you can't beat yourself up over it. Here are some thoughts on failures.
  
  <!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```

---

_****_

I notice there's a repetition in the updated introduction. Let me fix that to make it flow better:

---

_****_

```diff
  ---
  
- Failure is not an option; it's a necessity. Failure is not an option; it's a requirement. Failure is not a person but an event. You learn how to move on, learn why it failed, and make judgments.

  <!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```

---

_****_

I've updated the introduction paragraph to include your additional thoughts about failure. The new introduction now reads:

"Failure is not an option; it's a necessity and a requirement. Failure is not a person but an event. You learn how to move on, learn why it failed, and make judgments. You can't grow without failing, and you can't beat yourself up over it. Here are some thoughts on failures."

This captures all the key points you wanted to include:
- Failure is a requirement
- Failure is an event, not a person
- You learn to move on and learn from failures
- Growth requires failure
- You shouldn't beat yourself up over failures

The introduction now provides a more comprehensive perspective on failure while maintaining good grammar and flow. Would you like me to make any other changes to the introduction or other parts of the blog post?

_**User**_

Re-write a bit: 

List out all the lines/points so I can reorder

Tell me before writing 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll list out all the key points from your introduction paragraph so you can decide on the order you prefer before I rewrite it:

Current introduction points:
1. "Failure is not an option; it's a necessity and a requirement."
2. "Failure is not a person but an event."
3. "You learn how to move on, learn why it failed, and make judgments."
4. "You can't grow without failing"
5. "You can't beat yourself up over it."
6. "Here are some thoughts on failures."

Would you like to reorder these points? Please let me know your preferred order, and I'll rewrite the introduction accordingly.

---

_**User**_

Re-order like: 

1, 2, 4, 5 ,  but change order of 3 to be how to analyze without judgement,  why it failed, how to move on, 6

---

_**Assistant**_

Based on your requested reordering, I'll rewrite the introduction with this structure:

1. "Failure is not an option; it's a necessity and a requirement."
2. "Failure is not a person but an event."
3. "You can't grow without failing"
4. "You can't beat yourself up over it."
5. Modified point 3: "Analyze without judgment, understand why it failed, and learn how to move on."
6. "Here are some thoughts on failures."

Let me rewrite the introduction with this new order:

---

_****_

```diff
  ---
  
- Failure is not an option; it's a necessity and a requirement. Failure is not a person but an event. You learn how to move on, learn why it failed, and make judgments. You can't grow without failing, and you can't beat yourself up over it. Here are some thoughts on failures.
+ Failure is not an option; it's a necessity and a requirement. Failure is not a person but an event. You can't grow without failing, and you can't beat yourself up over it. The key is to analyze without judgment, understand why it failed, and learn how to move on. Here are some thoughts on failures.
  
  <!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```

---

_****_

I've rewritten the introduction paragraph according to your requested order and modifications. The new introduction now reads:

"Failure is not an option; it's a necessity and a requirement. Failure is not a person but an event. You can't grow without failing, and you can't beat yourself up over it. The key is to analyze without judgment, understand why it failed, and learn how to move on. Here are some thoughts on failures."

The flow now follows your preferred structure:
1. Establishes that failure is necessary and required
2. Clarifies that failure is an event, not a person
3. Emphasizes that growth requires failure
4. Reminds not to beat yourself up over failures
5. Explains the approach: analyze without judgment, understand causes, and move forward
6. Transitions to the rest of the content

Does this reordering and rewriting meet your expectations? Would you like to make any further adjustments to the introduction?

_**Assistant**_

I'll remove "Here are some thoughts on failures" from the introduction:

I've removed "Here are some thoughts on failures" from the introduction. The introduction now reads:

"Failure is not an option; it's a necessity and a requirement. Failure is not a person but an event. You can't grow without failing, and you can't beat yourself up over it. The key is to analyze without judgment, understand why it failed, and learn how to move on."

The introduction is now more concise and focused on the key points about failure without the transitional phrase at the end.

_**User**_

Get rid of anda. requirement

_**Assistant**_

I'll remove "and a requirement" from the introduction:

- Failure is not an option; it's a necessity and a requirement. Failure is not a person but an event. You can't grow without failing, and you can't beat yourself up over it. The key is to analyze without judgment, understand why it failed, and learn how to move on.

  <!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```

---

_****_

I've removed "and a requirement" from the first sentence of the introduction. The introduction now reads:

"Failure is not an option; it's a necessity. Failure is not a person but an event. You can't grow without failing, and you can't beat yourself up over it. The key is to analyze without judgment, understand why it failed, and learn how to move on."

The introduction is now more concise and avoids the redundancy between "necessity" and "requirement".

and learn to move on.

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the phrase "and learn how to move on" to "and learn to move on" for better flow:

---

_****_

```diff

- Failure is not an option; it's a necessity. Failure is not a person but an event. You can't grow without failing, and you can't beat yourself up over it. The key is to analyze without judgment, understand why it failed, and learn how to move on.
+ Failure is not an option; it's a necessity. Failure is not a person but an event. You can't grow without failing, and you can't beat yourself up over it. The key is to analyze without judgment, understand why it failed, and learn to move on.
  
  <!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```

---

_****_

I've updated the phrase in the introduction to "and learn to move on" instead of "and learn how to move on." The introduction now reads:

"Failure is not an option; it's a necessity. Failure is not a person but an event. You can't grow without failing, and you can't beat yourself up over it. The key is to analyze without judgment, understand why it failed, and learn to move on."

This small change makes the sentence flow more smoothly and is more concise.
