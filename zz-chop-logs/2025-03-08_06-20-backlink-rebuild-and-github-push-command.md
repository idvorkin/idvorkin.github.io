## Backlink Rebuild and GitHub Push Command (3/8/2025, 6:20:04 AM)

_**User**_

Can we build a command to just push-new-backliniks, that rebuilds backlinks and then pushes them to github with a good commit message, maybe have a aftety to make sure not too much has changed share plan first

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a command to rebuild and push backlinks with safety checks. Let's first understand the current backlinks system by examining the relevant files.

Let's examine the build_back_links.py script to understand how backlinks are currently generated:

Let's also look at the back-links.json file to understand its structure:

Now, let's check if there are any existing scripts that might be related to pushing backlinks to GitHub:

Now let's check how the git repository is structured and if there are any existing commit patterns for backlinks:

```

---

Based on my analysis, I'll now create a script to rebuild and push backlinks with safety checks. Let's create a new command in the Justfile:

---

_****_

```diff
  prepare:
      husky install
+ 
+ # Rebuild backlinks and push to GitHub with safety checks
+ push-backlinks:
+     #!/usr/bin/env sh
+     # Save the current state of back-links.json
+     cp back-links.json back-links.json.bak
+     
+     # Rebuild backlinks
+     echo "Rebuilding backlinks..."
+     ./build_back_links.py build
+     
+     # Check if there are changes
+     if ! git diff --quiet back-links.json; then
+         # Count the number of changed lines
+         CHANGED_LINES=$(git diff --numstat back-links.json | awk '{print $1 + $2}')
+         echo "Number of changed lines: $CHANGED_LINES"
+         
+         # If too many lines changed, ask for confirmation
+         if [ "$CHANGED_LINES" -gt 50 ]; then
+             echo "WARNING: Large number of changes detected ($CHANGED_LINES lines)"
+             echo "Showing diff summary:"
+             git diff --stat back-links.json
+             
+             # Ask for confirmation
+             read -p "Do you want to continue with the push? (y/n) " CONFIRM
+             if [ "$CONFIRM" != "y" ]; then
+                 echo "Operation cancelled. Restoring backup..."
+                 mv back-links.json.bak back-links.json
+                 exit 1

Now let's test the new command to make sure it works correctly:

_**User**_

Writebacklinks  to ~/tmp create if doesn't exist. Use the other just commands when possible. 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll create a command to write backlinks to ~/tmp, making sure the directory exists first. I'll use existing just commands where possible.

```diff

+     # Copy backlinks to ~/tmp
+     cp back-links.json ~/tmp/back-links.json
