Based on the blog rules and the current content of the post, I notice a few areas where we could improve the post to better align with the blog conventions:

1. The post follows most of the basic formatting rules but could benefit from some enhancements:
   - It has proper front matter with redirects
   - It has a well-structured table of contents
   - The sections are properly hierarchical

2. According to the blog content rules, we could enhance it by:
   - Adding relevant book references using the amazon.html include
   - Adding some visual elements using blob_image_float_right.html
   - Expanding some of the empty sections (like "Relation to Procrastination" and "Relation to the Dip")
   - Adding more concrete examples in sections like "Mitigating at work"

3. Following the writing style rules, we could:
   - Add more concrete examples to balance the abstract concepts
   - Expand on the practical applications in each section
   - Ensure consistent use of active voice throughout
   - Add more transitions between sections

Would you like me to help you improve any specific aspect of this post? I can help with:
1. Adding relevant book references
2. Finding and adding appropriate images
3. Expanding the empty sections
4. Enhancing the examples and practical applications
5. Improving the writing style and transitions

Let me know which aspects you'd like to focus on first!
