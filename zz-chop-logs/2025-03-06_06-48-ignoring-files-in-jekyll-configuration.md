_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add "zz-chop-logs" to be ignored by Jekyll. First, let me check the Jekyll configuration file to see where we need to make this change.

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "_config.yml" â€¢ **1** results</summary>
        
| File |
|------|
| `undefined` |

</details>

Now let me examine the content of the Jekyll configuration file to see the current exclusion settings:

---

_****_

Read file: _config.yml

I can see the `exclude` section in the Jekyll configuration file. Now I'll edit the file to add "zz-chop-logs" to the list of excluded directories.

---

_****_

```diff
      "cursor-logs",
      "chop-logs",
+     "zz-chop-logs",
      ".aider.tags.cache.v3",
      ".husky",
```

I've successfully added "zz-chop-logs" to the list of directories that Jekyll will ignore during the build process. This means:

1. Any files or directories in "zz-chop-logs" will not be processed by Jekyll
2. These files won't be included in the generated site
3. This is useful for keeping logs, temporary files, or other development artifacts out of your published site

The change has been applied to your `_config.yml` file. The next time you build your Jekyll site, the "zz-chop-logs" directory will be excluded from processing.

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with regarding Jekyll configuration or other aspects of your site?
