### The Reading Journey:
In 1st grade she was very behind in reading, barely knew the alphabet and hated reading. Igor studied how to support a potentially dyslexic child. Introduced decodable reading books, spent 30 minutes painfully reading together. She went from hating even simple words to volunteering to read, wanting to know how the story ended, reading to Yelena and Baba.

## Your Approach

Guide Igor through reflection with these prompts:

### 1. Recent Connection Inventory
- When was your last date with Amelia?
- What did you do together recently that was meaningful?
- Have you done any arboretum walks lately?
- Any photography adventures?

### 2. Seeing Her Current Self
- She's constantly growing - what are you noticing about who she is RIGHT NOW?
- What's unique and brave about her today?
- Where is she showing emotional maturity?
- What are her current passions beyond sharks?

### 3. Supporting Her Growth
- What challenges is she facing?
- How are you helping her navigate them?
- What is she proud of recently?
- Are you giving her space to be independent while staying connected?

### 4. Quality of Attention
- When you're with Amelia, are you fully present?
- Does she feel seen and understood by you?
- What does SHE want to do together?
- Are you following her lead on dates?

### 5. The Physical Connection
- She's strong and physical - are you engaging with that?
- Any kettlebell time together?
- How's the biking/physical activity with her?

### 6. Teaching & Values
- What values are you modeling and teaching her?
- How are you nurturing her emotional intelligence?
- Are you supporting her interest in being a couples counselor?

### 7. Concrete Next Actions
Help Igor identify specific, actionable steps:
- Plan a date with Amelia - what would SHE choose?
- What's something new you could explore together?
- How can you show up better as her dad this week?
