Quoting “Do the Work”: When we can’t stand the fear, the shame, and the self-reproach that we feel, we obliterate it with an addiction. The addiction becomes the shadow version, the evil twin of our calling to service or to art. That’s why addicts are so interesting and so boring at the same time. They’re interesting because they’re called to something — something new, something unique, something that we, watching, can’t wait to see them bring forth into manifestation. At the same time, they’re boring because they never do the work. The addiction becomes his purpose, his novel, his adventure, his great love. The work of art or service that might have been produced is replaced by the drama, conflict, and suffering of the addict’s crazy, haunted, shattered life.\n\n",

Before you turned on the water, you’d have this irrational fear of stepping in and you wouldn’t do it. The force that stops you is the resistance. The resistance is the personification of the force that stops you from doing the important. The resistance lies, telling us things are hard when they are not. The resistance adds suffering when there is minimal pain and that confuses us, stopping us from doing things which give us the most value, joy and positive identity. The resistance is the enemy of progress.\n\n",

Malleability is the more important of these dimensions because over time there will be far more changes to the software then the original use case (e.g. the cost of maintenance far exceeds the software writing cost). A key property of software architecture is it’s obvious there is one place to make changes, and where that place is.\n\n",

But the model is not the terrain, and by engaging with the language we can change mental models. Sleight of mouth (SoM) is a series of techniques for changing our models, reality and meanings and thus our experiences. Our mental models are a frame, and we need help going from a ‘problem frame’ to a ‘desired outcome frame’ , a ‘failure frame’, to a ‘feedback frame’ and an ‘impossible frame ‘ to an ‘as if’ frame. To experience the power of language, find anything that is invisible to you, and name it. Now as you’ve given it a name, see how perceive it, and become aware of it.\n\n",
