They’re interesting because they’re called to something — something new, something unique, something that we, watching, can’t wait to see them bring forth into manifestation. At the same time, they’re boring because they never do the work. The addiction becomes his purpose, his novel, his adventure, his great love. The work of art or service that might have been produced is replaced by the drama, conflict, and suffering of the addict’s crazy, haunted, shattered life.\n\n",

When I talk about the good, I’ll talk about the ideal good, and when I talk about the bad, I’ll talk to some issues I saw that were systemically bad.

I told Tori, my wife, who normally drives the kids to school. Tori didn’t acknowledge me. As I got my bike helmet Tori put the kids in the car. I ran out and tried to get her attention, waving frantically and running the car. (In my head), Tori ignored me, wouldn’t look at me, even as I ran to the car and gesticulated wildly. I really had my heart set on biking Amelia to school, and I went into a rage, as Tori pulled off, I flipped her off. Adulting fail - not my best moment.\n\n",

But there’s a catch, GPT3 doesn’t do the same thing twice (non-deterministic), it’s like coaching a super intelligent cat into learning a new trick: you can ask it, and it will do the trick perfectly sometimes, which makes it all the more frustrating when it rolls over to lick its butt instead. You know the problem is not that it can’t but that it won’t(From Gwern).\n\n",

I failed as a husband, a father, a brother, friend, and as a kind human being. It is a hard pill to swallow that I was the Evil one. Why did I fail? Me. My brain. My manic self. I wanted more than anything to prove them wrong. That I could do this. But I couldn’t. You can learn a lot, but you can’t unlearn bipolar disorder. I desperately wanted to believe that bipolar disorder wasn’t real and that I could stop living in fear of it. That all the doubters were wrong (from a friend with bipolar).\n\n",
