They’re interesting because they’re called to something — something new, something unique, something that we, watching, can’t wait to see them bring forth into manifestation. At the same time, they’re boring because they never do the work. The addiction becomes his purpose, his novel, his adventure, his great love. The work of art or service that might have been produced is replaced by the drama, conflict, and suffering of the addict’s crazy, haunted, shattered life.\n\n",

This was O’Kelly’s reality, and his response was remarkable: he chose to approach his death with the same clarity and purpose that had marked his life. This is what I learned from his story.\n\n",

The veil of happiness, and you believe you’re seeing the world as it truly is: alone, petrifying, and painful. But the truth lies. The depressed say “No one loves me.” And you say, “I love you, your wife loves you, your mother loves you.” and the depressed ignore you. The depressed will continue, “None of this matters, we’re just going to die in the end.” To which you have to say, “That’s true, but I think right now should focus on what to have for breakfast.”\n\n",

End user behavior is the delivery of use cases, while malleability is the ease with which the software can modify the existing use cases, or add new ones. Software malleability is the evaluation function for an architecture. Malleability is the more important of these dimensions because over time there will be far more changes to the software then the original use case (e.g. the cost of maintenance far exceeds the software writing cost). A key property of software architecture is it’s obvious there is one place to make changes, and where that place is.\n\n",

Being an essentialist means you say ‘I choose to’ not ‘I have to’, ‘Only a few things matter’, not ‘all things matter’ and ‘I will do one thing’, not ‘I will do both’. The essential questions are ‘How do I know when I’m done?’, ‘If I didn’t own this, would I buy it?’, ‘If I didn’t have this opportunity what would I do to acquire it?’\n\n",

But that magic is fragile: on follow-up turns, or when you have a much tighter definition of correct, the inferred intent often changes, and the model applies a different set of constraints then you wanted or what it did previously, causing a cliff, or misery.

            "description": "Love your work, and you’ll never work a day in your life. Sounds great, but work ain’t no Caribbean cruise - one you pay for, and the other pays you. Work should be satisfying (SAT). You should be enjoying solving hard problems, getting opportunities to talk with like-minded people, and even being forced to stretch and grow. Work should also cause you dissatisfaction (DSAT). Some days your boss will piss you off, your co-workers will misunderstand you, and you will be forced to do something you don’t want to. Satisfaction is not a lack of dissatisfaction; they are orthogonal experiences. DSAT is what makes you sleep poorly, and SAT is what makes you set your alarm early Monday morning so you can get back to your favorite project, and to hang out with your awesome team.  By understanding our SAT and DSAT, we can change them, and transform hours slogging into time at the fantasy cruise bar.\n\n",
