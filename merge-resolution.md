# Merge Resolution Strategy

## Current Situation
- Branch: add-typos-spell-checker
- Main branch has commit de72173 with typo fixes in content files
- Main branch has incomplete .typos.toml with entries like "realy" = "realy" (doesn't fix typos)
- Our branch has comprehensive .typos.toml and proper pre-commit integration

## Resolution Strategy
1. Keep all content file typo fixes from main
2. Use our superior .typos.toml configuration 
3. Use our pre-commit-config.yaml with proper args

## Files Analysis
Our current files are correct:
- .typos.toml: Comprehensive config without incorrect entries
- .pre-commit-config.yaml: Includes `args: []` for proper typos configuration

Main branch issues:
- .typos.toml: Has incorrect entries like "realy" = "realy" that don't fix typos
- .pre-commit-config.yaml: Missing args configuration for typos
