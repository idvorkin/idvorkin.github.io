Let me search for the CHOP post in the drafts directory to find the exact location to update.

---

_\*\*\*\*_

Read file: \_d/ai-coder.md

---

_\*\*\*\*_

I'll add the information about enabling large context in the Cursor Tips section. Let me edit the file:

---

_\*\*\*\*_

```diff
     - Great for refactoring and architecture discussions

+ 3. **Enable Large Context**
+    - Go to Settings -> Features
+    - Enable "Large Context" option
+    - Allows AI to understand more of your codebase at once
+    - Improves code comprehension and suggestions
+    - Especially helpful for complex refactoring tasks
+
  ##### Export Cursor Chats

```

_\*\*\*\*_

I've added a new tip about enabling large context in Cursor settings. The addition:

1. Maintains the same formatting style as the existing tips
2. Provides clear instructions on where to find the setting
3. Explains the benefits of enabling large context
4. Fits naturally in the existing Cursor Tips section

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this addition?

Have a single line on why/what

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the large context tip to have a single clear line about why/what it does. Let me edit the file:

---

_\*\*\*\*_

```diff

  3. **Enable Large Context**
+    - Dramatically improves AI's ability to understand your entire codebase at once
     - Go to Settings -> Features
     - Enable "Large Context" option
-    - Allows AI to understand more of your codebase at once
-    - Improves code comprehension and suggestions
-    - Especially helpful for complex refactoring tasks

  ##### Export Cursor Chats
```

---

_\*\*\*\*_

I've simplified the large context tip to:

1. One clear line explaining what it does
2. Two simple steps for enabling it
3. Removed redundant explanations

The change maintains the same structure as other tips while being more concise. Would you like me to make any other adjustments?
