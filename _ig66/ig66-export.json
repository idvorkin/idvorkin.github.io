I was super excited about walking on the bridge but unfortunately, when we got there, the bridge was already closed to tourists. I was pretty grumpy. Salvaging the day, Tori, knowing how much I love riding the subway, told Zach to pick a Subway adventure for us. Zach picked Bainbridge Island, which meant we got to ride the subway to the ferry, hang out on the island and then reverse the process.",

When I got home Tori had a pounding headache, so I got an opportunity to give her a well deserved nap. I took the kids off for dinner, and, you guessed it, we took the light rail. Our destination was china town where we ate @ one of Zach's favorite restaurants. The best part of the trip was Zach and Amelia playing together.",

In the 7 days it's been open, I've ridden it 10 times, and I'm looking forward to riding it more as I learn what's at stops further down the line. A great thing about taking the family to the subway is it gives us a chance to hang out without hurry or distractions. For example, last night we took 30 no pressure minutes to our destination - frozen yogurt, where we hung out and ate a taste desert before turning around and repeating the process. Because there's no hurry or distraction, we can talk and listen to each other.",

As silly as this sounds it didn't occur to me that when going to Wild Waves we should bring swim suits and towels. The name \"wild waves\", and the pictures of the many water slides, simply didn't click. Even without the water paraphernalia, there was lots to do. Lots of rides for the kids. There were even a few rides that Zach and Amelia were able to do together. Zach wasn't thrilled by the arrangement, but Amelia thought it was a hoot.",

I hurried Zach to the door of the 7/11 but Zach dug in his heels preventing me from pulling him into the gas station. \"I want to poo on a tree\" Zach declared. I froze in my tracks, temporarily confused. My eyes darted around looking for a secluded tree, but being down town, there are none to be found. I returned to my senses and negotiated with Zach. A few minutes laters, Zach flushed the toilet, washed his hands, and I nodded approval to my reflection in the gas station's bathroom mirror.",

Zach has started watching Spiderman cartoons and Mom has been trying to explain about bad guys versus good guys. Snidely Whiplash fan that she is, Mom taught Zach about villains, which is a much cooler word than 'bad guys.' Mom is also trying to convince Zach to cover his mouth and nose when sneezing and to wash his hands, hence the germ discussion. Mom is also a little paranoid about the annual family flu that seems to strike around Zach's birthday and might have told Zach a few times too often that we are not doing the flu this year",

While Tori is concerned, I have a more pragmatic approach - we need to borrower a bigger kid with a bigger stick, and the problem should take care of itself.",

On the bright side, we've made lots of pictures and movies.\n\nWhat really amazes me about Zach is how he's getting better at everything. A trivial example is how Zach walks down the stairs. A few weeks ago Zach would simply step down, and he wouldn't care where his weight bearing leg was (resulting in falls). Now Zach knows better, and makes sure his weight bearing leg is as close possible to edge before stepping down. It's cool to watch the development. Zach's learning to play with balls and it's super fun to watch. He'll pick up a ball, go to throw it forward, and then be confused when it flies backwards. I'm sure a few more weeks and he'll be throwing the ball farther than I can fetch it.",

We'll take him to the park to swing, slide, or play in the dirt, sometimes Zach will just run up and down stairs, or ladders if we're not paying attention.",

As we were trying to decide if we needed to go to the hospital, I was counting Zach's breathing every few minutes. I recall thinking that keeping track of Zach's fast breathing was causing me my own respistory distress.",

To make a good cup of sencha you must have water at the right temperature and you must steep for 2 minutes. Steep Sencha too long and it is bitter and nasty. Temperature is easy for me, but not over brewing is a huge pain. Two minutes is too long for me to do nothing, so I start doing the 'next thing' and forget about my tea. As I ponder my ruined tea dilemma it occurs to me the answer to my problem might be a 2 minute breathing exercise between prepare and drink. As I ponder more, it seems I'll have the same problem - perhaps I'll go out and buy an egg timer instead",

The laundry air holes even let you play peek a boo with ZachO! If you're going to use a laundry basket for your newborn I recommend a hip hugger.",

Making things worse my friends and colleagues were assaulting me with stories of pregnancies gone wrong - and I was stupidly relaying these terrible exaggerated stories on to Tori who was not enjoying them.",

Mulled wine with rum (something we'll have to investigate for our next party) took the edge off as we searched for the next museum. We got distracted by a search for Frank Gehry's whale and then a epic journey to find the remains of the Berlin wall drained our resources. We needed to re-charge and a meat sandwich hit the spot. Next we quested for the German parliament and lego land. A few shots with me and a giraffe later, and it was time for coffee and apple strudel. I'm told for apple strudel in Berlin there is only one choice - Einsteins, and I have to agree.",

Who would build a second largest tower you ask? Well, it turns out the tallest tower was the Moscow TV tower,and communist pride wouldn't allow you to build a tower bigger than the one in the mother land. To understand the second funny thing about the tower you need to understand that Russia doesn't believe in religion, so it is constantly tearing down religious artifacts like crosses. Well it turns out when the sun reflects on the disco ball in the TV tower, it forms a giant cross made of reflecting sunlight - this is what Berliners call the Pope's revenge :)",

Their witty response below:\n\n> OK Victoria, Brian and I went to the picture site and looked at quite a few photos. We were especially impressed by the window display of the carved wooden dicks. Christmas shopping? If so, I'll pass, but I think they'd be perfect for the rest of the family. Especially Kathy. I know she doesn't already have one. I have a lovely tin you can pack it in. We also liked the shot of Igor au naturale with his keyboard in his lap. Very few can get away with a shot like that. And since none of the rest of us have men without raging inhibitions it makes for a nice change. Want me to print it out and show it to your Grandmother? Maybe it will start a trend. Perhaps Ed will consider posing with a circular saw or Scott will vogue with a stick of dynamite. Very carefully placed. As for the house...it would have been more interesting to see the house rather than your collection of college-era furniture. You might want to consider going to the dump...Nonetheless, the house looks way better than many of the places we lived, and the neighborhood does indeed appear to be respectable. Hopefully the three of you won't spoil that. Life on the Ranch hasn't changed much. The new calf is well and I just bought a highland heifer from Yakima, WA who should be arriving next month I think. Her name is Lass, and she is bred, so her calf is expected next March. She's pedigreed up the wazoo, so the ranch is going upscale. Either that or I'm just pissing away money. Depends on whether you're talking to me or Brian.",
