Weather is finally amazing! Our first non-stop sun weekend, I'm making tonnes of balloons, Tori is back in the garden, and the kids are growing up!

Most everything is better in perfect weather, and bubbles and balloons are no exceptions:

To my amazement, there are still "two dollar Tuesday" movies. Now that two dollars is 6.50, but that's still a great deal. On Tuesday we took the subway to see a movie, that's a mural from the theater - pretty cool.

Diet is hard, but I'm up for the challenge. Every day at lunch I have a salad. I like to joke to my co-workers, "I need to eat salads for the next year", but given how well I'm doing, it'll probably take me 3 weeks". But, that's the way this game is played. Sometimes I cheat, in this photo I was caught blue tongued. Amelia and I were hanging out at the roller rink, and she wanted a slurpie, so I obliged, and then sampled.

Did I mention the kids are growing up? Yesterday Amelia was like, Dad I think my bike is too small, lets take out a bigger one. One size bigger, here we go!

Any whoo ....
