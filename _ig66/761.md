12 weeks ago I went kayaking, and I wrote a blog. This week, I went kayaking, and I'm now wriiting a blog.  It's winter in Seattle, which means short, rainy days, which also means if you wear a wetsuit, and don't mind your tesla smelling like lake ass, it's a perfect time to Kayak.


First, my new Kayak. Tori will claim I own many Kayaks, which I never use. Well, I'll have used this one at least once. And I love it! 26 lbs, with foot rests, I think this will be  a winner:
