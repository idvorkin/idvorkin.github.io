This year for the fourth of July we got invited out to a 4th of July party. It was our first 4th of July party in a very, very long time and we had a blast. Conveniently, Ammon's family was out of town, and he wanted to make cake, so he made cakes and brought them to us.

Ammon's cakes are always amazing:

For the party, we didn't make it all the way till the fireworks, good thing as I go to bed at 8:

- I biked Amelia there while Tori drove Zach and the cake.
- Didn't gorge, eat really moderately (though I did have a sliver of Ammon's cake)
- Did balloons
- Ran Bubble Machine
- Did Magic - kids screaming with joy
- Tried riding a skateboard, didn't go so well.
