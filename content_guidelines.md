# Content Guidelines by Post Type

## Core Consistency Rules

### Style Consistency Principle

**If you choose to deviate from the recommended style guidelines below, maintain that deviation consistently throughout the entire piece.** Mixing styles within a single post creates jarring reader experiences.

**Examples of acceptable consistent deviations:**

- Using "we" throughout an entire post (but never mixing "we" and "I")
- Writing in third person for a specific piece (but maintaining it throughout)
- Using formal academic tone for technical content (but not switching to conversational mid-post)
- Adopting a specific narrative voice for storytelling posts

### Inconsistency Warnings

**AI assistants and editors should flag these inconsistencies:**

- ❌ Switching between "I" and "we" within the same post
- ❌ Mixing formal and conversational tones randomly
- ❌ Starting personal then becoming impersonal
- ❌ Inconsistent use of headers, bullet styles, or formatting
- ❌ Switching between metaphorical frameworks mid-post
- ❌ Changing target audience assumptions (expert → beginner → expert)

**The goal:** Readers should feel like they're having one coherent conversation, not multiple conversations stitched together.

## Universal Writing Style (All Content)

### Voice and Perspective

- **Always use "I"** for personal perspective, never "we"
- **Direct and concise** - avoid flowery language where it obscures meaning
- **Personal but pragmatic** tone
- **Conversational vulnerability** - write like you're having coffee with a thoughtful friend who shares real struggles
- **Vulnerable but authoritative** - show uncertainty alongside expertise
- **Systems thinking approach** - naturally build frameworks and structured approaches
- **Metaphorical thinking** - use consistent metaphors (dragons, mountains, rivers) to explain complex concepts

### Language Patterns

- **Questions to engage readers** and introduce new sections
- **Concrete examples** over abstract concepts
- **"Here's what I learned"** rather than "You should do this"
- **Strategic use of rich metaphors** when they enhance understanding
- **Self-deprecating humor** with phrases like "completely aspirational" and acknowledgment of personal flaws
- **Vulnerability as strength** - openly discussing fears, failures, and contradictions
- **Research integration** - heavy citing of books, studies, and external sources
- **Avoid marketing speak and buzzwords** - no "revolutionary," "game-changing," or corporate jargon

### Structure Elements

- **Extensive use of headers** for easy scanning
- **Bullet points** to chunk information
- **Table of contents** for longer pieces (auto-generated via vim-markdown-toc)
- **Heavy cross-referencing** using `{% include summarize-page.html %}` for internal linking
- **Progressive disclosure** - start with simple concepts, then drill deeper
- **Iterative development** - posts evolve over time with update notes
- **Framework building** - most posts end with practical application methods

### Engagement Techniques

- **Rhetorical questions** as section breaks
- **Direct reader address** ("I bet you don't either")
- **Dialog format** for internal conflicts and decision-making (real and imagined conversations)
- **Real-time authenticity** - admit uncertainty and show work in progress
- **Meta-commentary** on your own writing and thinking process
- **Personal anecdotes as teaching tools** - stories that illustrate broader principles
- **Pre-mortem/scenario planning** - regular use of "what if" thinking

## Content Development Workflow

### 1. Start with Purpose

- **Personal processing** - What am I trying to figure out?
- **Public value** - How can this help others?
- **Framework building** - What systematic approach am I developing?

### 2. Choose Content Type

- Match your purpose to the appropriate content type above
- Consider hybrid approaches for complex topics
- Plan for potential evolution (exploration → framework → published advice)

### 3. Apply Type-Specific Guidelines

- Use the voice and structure patterns for your chosen type
- Include all key elements relevant to that content type
- Follow the suggested length guidelines

### 4. Cross-Link and Connect

- Reference related content throughout
- Build connections between different frameworks
- Update existing content with new insights

### 5. Tag and Organize

- Use consistent tagging system
- Include type-specific tags plus topic tags
- Consider searchability and future discovery

## Special Considerations

### Dual-Purpose Content

Most substantial content should serve both personal processing AND public teaching. This is your superpower - turning personal work into valuable public content.

### Living Documents

Many pieces should be treated as living documents that get updated over time with new insights, examples, and refinements.

### Authentic Vulnerability

Your willingness to show uncertainty, mistakes, and work-in-progress thinking is what makes the content uniquely valuable. Maintain this across all content types.

### Framework Thinking

You naturally build systematic approaches to complex topics. Lean into this strength by making frameworks explicit and reusable.

### Meta-Awareness

Your ability to comment on your own thinking process adds depth and authenticity. Include this meta-commentary where it serves the content.

## Technical Implementation Guide

### Alert Boxes

Use alert boxes to highlight important information, warnings, or construction notices:

**Syntax:**

```liquid
{% include alert.html content="Your message here" style="info" %}
{% include alert.html content="Warning or caution message" style="warning" %}
{% include alert.html content="Work in progress notice" style="danger" %}
```

**Common use cases:**

- Construction/work-in-progress notices
- Important caveats or disclaimers
- Cross-references to related content
- Privilege acknowledgments

**Example:**

```liquid
{% include alert.html content="🚧 Construction Zone 🚧 This post is in heavy progress! 🔨 Check back later for updates ⏳" style="warning" %}
```

### URL Redirects

Set up redirects for shorter, memorable URLs using both `redirect_from` and `alias`:

**Syntax:**

```yaml
redirect_from:
  - /shortname
  - /abbreviation
alias:
  - /shortname
  - /abbreviation
```

**Example:**

```yaml
redirect_from:
  - /7habits
  - /7h
alias:
  - /7habits
  - /7h
```

### Book Links and Amazon Affiliate Integration

Use the Amazon include for book references with ASIN numbers:

**Syntax:**

```liquid
{% include amazon.html asin="ASIN_NUMBER" %}
{% include amazon.html asin="ASIN1;ASIN2;ASIN3" %}
```

**Examples:**

```liquid
{% include amazon.html asin="0071499938" %}
{% include amazon.html asin="B07LDSPRYM;B00506CSDQ;B07C66Z4M4" %}
```

**How it works:**

- ASINs are looked up in `_data/asins.json` for title, image, and description
- Automatically includes affiliate tag (`ighe-20`)
- Falls back to generic Amazon image if product data not available
- Supports multiple books separated by semicolons
- Images are styled consistently with fallback text if images fail to load

**Best practices:**

- Use ASIN numbers (found in Amazon URLs) rather than direct links
- Group related books together in single include
- Place near relevant text sections
- ASIN data is managed automatically via scripts in `/scripts/` directory

### Images

Use the custom image includes for consistent formatting:

**Right-floating images:**

```liquid
{% include blob_image_float_right.html src="blog/image-name.webp" %}
```

**Standard images:**

```liquid
{% include blob_image.html src="blog/image-name.webp" %}
```

**Small right-floating images (25% width):**

```liquid
{% include blob_image_float_right_w25.html src="blog/image-name.webp" %}
```

**Image best practices:**

- Use WebP format for efficiency
- Store images in the GitHub blob: `https://github.com/idvorkin/blob/raw/master/blog/filename.webp`
- Reference using relative paths in includes: `blog/filename.webp`
- Place floating images near relevant text sections

### Cross-References and Internal Linking

Use the summarize-page include for rich internal linking:

**Syntax:**

```liquid
{% include summarize-page.html src="/page-name" %}
```

**How it works:**

- Automatically pulls title and description from the linked page
- Creates a styled summary box with proper attribution
- Uses data from `back-links.json` for consistent metadata
- Provides rich preview of the linked content

**When to use:**

- Referencing related comprehensive posts
- Building connections between related frameworks
- Providing deeper dive options
- Creating content clusters around themes
- Cross-linking between book summaries and related life posts

**Examples:**

```liquid
{% include summarize-page.html src="/7habits" %}
{% include summarize-page.html src="/death" %}
{% include summarize-page.html src="/gap-year" %}
```

### Quadrant Matrix (2x2 Grid Visualization)

Use the quadrant-matrix include for any 2x2 grid visualizations like personality types, decision matrices, or prioritization frameworks:

**Syntax:**

```liquid
{% include quadrant-matrix.html
    title="Main Title"
    subtitle="Optional subtitle"
    x_label="X Axis Label →"
    y_label="Y Axis Label →"
    q1_name="TOP-RIGHT NAME"
    q1_subtitle="Optional subtitle"
    q1_traits="Line 1<br>Line 2<br>Line 3"
    q1_color="rgba(255, 224, 224, 0.5)"
    q2_name="TOP-LEFT NAME"
    q2_subtitle="Optional subtitle"
    q2_traits="Description here"
    q2_color="rgba(230, 230, 250, 0.5)"
    q3_name="BOTTOM-LEFT NAME"
    q3_subtitle="Optional subtitle"
    q3_traits="Description here"
    q3_color="rgba(232, 244, 234, 0.5)"
    q4_name="BOTTOM-RIGHT NAME"
    q4_subtitle="Optional subtitle"
    q4_traits="Description here"
    q4_color="rgba(255, 229, 180, 0.5)"
%}
```

**Parameters:**

- `title`, `subtitle`: Main headings for the matrix
- `x_label`, `y_label`: Axis labels with directional arrows
- `q1-q4`: Quadrants numbered clockwise from top-right
  - `q#_name`: Main heading in quadrant
  - `q#_subtitle`: Optional subtitle
  - `q#_traits`: Description (use `<br>` for line breaks)
  - `q#_color`: Background color (hex or rgba)

**Common use cases:**

- **PANAS Personality Types**: Mad Scientist, Cheerleader, Judge, Poet
- **Eisenhower Matrix**: Urgent/Important task prioritization
- **Risk Assessment**: Probability/Impact matrix
- **SWOT Analysis**: Strengths/Weaknesses/Opportunities/Threats
- **Energy Management**: High/Low energy vs High/Low focus

**Example - PANAS Personality Types:**

```liquid
{% include quadrant-matrix.html
    title="Arthur Brooks' PANAS Personality Types"
    subtitle="Based on the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule"
    x_label="Positive Affect →"
    y_label="Negative Affect →"
    q1_name="MAD SCIENTIST"
    q1_subtitle="Creative Intensity"
    q1_traits="Feels deeply<br>Passionate<br>Ride the waves"
    q1_color="rgba(255, 224, 224, 0.5)"
    q2_name="JUDGE"
    q2_subtitle="Critical Thinker"
    q2_traits="Spots problems<br>High standards<br>Practice gratitude"
    q2_color="rgba(230, 230, 250, 0.5)"
    q3_name="POET"
    q3_subtitle="Calm Observer"
    q3_traits="Steady emotions<br>Zen-like presence<br>Cultivate excitement"
    q3_color="rgba(232, 244, 234, 0.5)"
    q4_name="CHEERLEADER"
    q4_subtitle="Natural Optimist"
    q4_traits="Spreads joy<br>Sees bright side<br>Watch for warnings"
    q4_color="rgba(255, 229, 180, 0.5)"
%}
```

### Jekyll Front Matter Essentials

Include these key elements in post front matter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
layout: post
permalink: /url-slug
imagefeature: https://github.com/idvorkin/blob/raw/master/blog/image.webp
tags:
  - relevant-tag
  - category-tag
redirect_from:
  - /short-url
alias:
  - /short-url
---
```

**IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION RULE:** Always use these technical elements consistently. Alert boxes for important notices, redirects for memorable URLs, affiliate links for books, proper image includes for formatting, summarize-page includes for internal references, and quadrant-matrix includes for 2x2 visualizations.
