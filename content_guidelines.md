# Content Guidelines by Post Type

## Core Consistency Rules

### Style Consistency Principle
**If you choose to deviate from the recommended style guidelines below, maintain that deviation consistently throughout the entire piece.** Mixing styles within a single post creates jarring reader experiences.

**Examples of acceptable consistent deviations:**
- Using "we" throughout an entire post (but never mixing "we" and "I")
- Writing in third person for a specific piece (but maintaining it throughout)
- Using formal academic tone for technical content (but not switching to conversational mid-post)
- Adopting a specific narrative voice for storytelling posts

### Inconsistency Warnings
**AI assistants and editors should flag these inconsistencies:**
- ❌ Switching between "I" and "we" within the same post
- ❌ Mixing formal and conversational tones randomly
- ❌ Starting personal then becoming impersonal
- ❌ Inconsistent use of headers, bullet styles, or formatting
- ❌ Switching between metaphorical frameworks mid-post
- ❌ Changing target audience assumptions (expert → beginner → expert)

**The goal:** Readers should feel like they're having one coherent conversation, not multiple conversations stitched together.

## Universal Writing Style (All Content)

### Voice and Perspective
- **Always use "I"** for personal perspective, never "we"
- **Direct and concise** - avoid flowery language where it obscures meaning
- **Personal but pragmatic** tone
- **Conversational** - write like you're having coffee with a thoughtful friend
- **Vulnerable but authoritative** - show uncertainty alongside expertise

### Language Patterns
- **Questions to engage readers** and introduce new sections
- **Concrete examples** over abstract concepts
- **"Here's what I learned"** rather than "You should do this"
- **Strategic use of rich metaphors** when they enhance understanding
- **Self-deprecating humor** used sparingly but effectively

### Structure Elements
- **Extensive use of headers** for easy scanning
- **Bullet points** to chunk information
- **Table of contents** for longer pieces (auto-generated via vim-markdown-toc)
- **Cross-linking** between related content
- **Progressive revelation** - build complexity throughout posts

### Engagement Techniques
- **Rhetorical questions** as section breaks
- **Direct reader address** ("I bet you don't either")
- **Dialog format** for internal conflicts and decision-making
- **Real-time authenticity** - admit uncertainty and show work in progress
- **Meta-commentary** on your own writing and thinking process

## Content Development Workflow

### 1. Start with Purpose
- **Personal processing** - What am I trying to figure out?
- **Public value** - How can this help others?
- **Framework building** - What systematic approach am I developing?

### 2. Choose Content Type
- Match your purpose to the appropriate content type above
- Consider hybrid approaches for complex topics
- Plan for potential evolution (exploration → framework → published advice)

### 3. Apply Type-Specific Guidelines
- Use the voice and structure patterns for your chosen type
- Include all key elements relevant to that content type
- Follow the suggested length guidelines

### 4. Cross-Link and Connect
- Reference related content throughout
- Build connections between different frameworks
- Update existing content with new insights

### 5. Tag and Organize
- Use consistent tagging system
- Include type-specific tags plus topic tags
- Consider searchability and future discovery

## Special Considerations

### Dual-Purpose Content
Most substantial content should serve both personal processing AND public teaching. This is your superpower - turning personal work into valuable public content.

### Living Documents
Many pieces should be treated as living documents that get updated over time with new insights, examples, and refinements.

### Authentic Vulnerability
Your willingness to show uncertainty, mistakes, and work-in-progress thinking is what makes the content uniquely valuable. Maintain this across all content types.

### Framework Thinking
You naturally build systematic approaches to complex topics. Lean into this strength by making frameworks explicit and reusable.

### Meta-Awareness
Your ability to comment on your own thinking process adds depth and authenticity. Include this meta-commentary where it serves the content.
