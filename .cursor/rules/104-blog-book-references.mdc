# Blog Book Reference Standards

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Context
- When adding book references to posts
- When updating existing book references
- When organizing book recommendations

## Requirements

1. Content Analysis
   - Review post content and themes
   - Check for existing amazon.html includes
   - If includes exist, ask user:
     ```
     I see existing book references. Would you like to:
     a) Keep them where they are
     b) Move them to the standard location (after introduction)
     c) Replace them with new books
     d) Add additional books?
     ```
   - Identify explicitly mentioned books
   - Recommend relevant books based on topics

2. ASIN Retrieval
   - For each book, verify ASIN:
     ```bash
     tony search "What is the ASIN for [book title]? Search Amazon too"
     ```
   - Extract ASIN from Amazon URL:
     - Format: amazon.com/dp/B0CP52YY8F
     - ASIN is the code after "/dp/"

3. Include Format
   - Use amazon.html include:
     ```markdown
     {% include amazon.html asin="ASIN1;ASIN2;ASIN3" %}
     ```
   - Multiple books:
     - Separate ASINs with semicolons
     - Keep to 2-3 books per row
     - Each book gets equal spacing

4. Include Features
   - Creates centered table with book covers
   - Each book cell contains:
     - Cover image (120px max width)
     - "View on Amazon" link
     - Affiliate code (ighe-20)
     - Light border and padding
   - Books arranged horizontally

5. Placement Guidelines
   - New references: After introducing books
   - Existing references: Based on user preference
   - Maintain blank lines before and after include
