# Permalink Management

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Context
- When changing a post's permalink
- When restructuring blog content
- When moving content to a new URL

## Rule Details

When changing a post's permalink:

1. Use the `redirect_from` front matter to maintain compatibility
2. This ensures old links continue to work
3. IMPORTANT: Do not use 'aliases' in front matter - it doesn't work

### Correct Format

```yaml
---
permalink: /new-url
redirect_from:
  - /old-url # ✅ correct way
---
```

### Incorrect Format

```yaml
---
permalink: /new-url
aliases: ["/old-url"] # ❌ wrong way - doesn't work
---
```

### Additional Steps

1. Check existing links to the post in other content and update if needed
2. The redirects are handled by Jekyll, no need to modify back-links.json

## Examples

<example>
# Good: Using redirect_from for permalink changes
---
title: "My Blog Post"
permalink: /new-post-url
redirect_from:
  - /old-post-url
  - /another-old-url
---
</example>

<example type="invalid">
# Bad: Using aliases instead of redirect_from
---
title: "My Blog Post"
permalink: /new-post-url
aliases: ["/old-post-url", "/another-old-url"]
---
</example>

## Reference Example
