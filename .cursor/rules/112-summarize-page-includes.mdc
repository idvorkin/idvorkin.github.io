# Using summarize-page Includes

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Context
- When including a summary of another page's content
- When referencing related topics
- When creating cross-references between blog posts

## Rule Details

When you want to include a summary of another page's content:

1. Use the `summarize-page` include with the format:
   ```markdown
   {% include summarize-page.html src="/page-url" %}
   ```

2. Before adding the include:
   - Always check `back-links.json` to confirm the correct permalink
   - The src should match the permalink, not the filename
   - Example: Use `/siy` for meditation content, not `/meditation`

3. The include will automatically:
   - Pull in the description from the target page
   - Add a link attribution to the source
   - Format it with proper styling

## Usage Patterns

Common usage patterns:
- After introducing a concept that's detailed elsewhere
- When listing related topics
- In sections that reference other content

## Examples

<example>
# Good: Using summarize-page with correct permalinks
**Affirmations**
Reinforcing positive beliefs and mindsets I want to cultivate.

{% include summarize-page.html src="/affirmations" %}

**Meditation**
My practice for mental clarity and focus.

{% include summarize-page.html src="/siy" %}
</example>

<example type="invalid">
# Bad: Using incorrect permalinks
**Meditation**
My practice for mental clarity and focus.

{% include summarize-page.html src="/meditation" %}  # Wrong: should be /siy
</example>

## Formatting

- Ensure there's a blank line before and after the include
- Place the include near relevant content
- Use a brief introduction before the include to provide context
