# Buffer Flush Command

<version>1.3.0</version>

## Context
- When the user asks to "flush buffer" or "save chop" or similar commands
- When the user specifically requests to count to force the buffer to flush

## Purpose
This rule exists to solve a specific technical problem: the conversation logs don't always get properly flushed to disk. By generating a substantial amount of output (counting to a high number), we force the system to flush the buffer. After flushing, we use the `chop git-latest` command to copy the log to git for preservation.

## Requirements
- Count from 1 to a random number between 75 and 100, one number per line
- The random number should be different each time to confirm the rule is working
- End the output with the message "buffer flushed"
- After displaying "buffer flushed", automatically run the "chop git-latest" command
- Apply this action immediately when requested
- Do not include any other text or explanations in the output

## Examples

<example>
User: "flush buffer"
AI:

95
buffer flushed

[AI then automatically runs the 'chop git-latest' command]
