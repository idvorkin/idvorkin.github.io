# Terminal Command Conventions

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Context
- When running terminal commands in scripts or through Cursor
- When working with commands that use pagers or require user interaction
- When running long-running commands that should continue in the background

## Rule Details

### Pager Commands

For ANY commands that would use a pager or require user interaction, you should append ` | /bin/cat` to the command (NOT just `cat` as it's aliased to `bat`). Otherwise, the command will break.

This applies to the following commands:
- git
- less
- head
- tail
- more
- man
- Any other command that would normally open a pager

#### Examples

<example>
# Good: Appending | /bin/cat to commands with pagers
git log | /bin/cat
git diff | /bin/cat
less file.txt | /bin/cat
head -n 100 large_file.txt | /bin/cat
</example>

<example type="invalid">
# Bad: Not appending | /bin/cat to commands with pagers
git log
git diff
less file.txt
head -n 100 large_file.txt
</example>

### Background Commands

For commands that are long running or expected to run indefinitely until interruption, run them in the background by:
1. Adding `&` at the end of the command
2. Setting `is_background` to true when using the run_terminal_cmd tool

#### Examples

<example>
# Good: Running long-running commands in the background
npm start &
python server.py &
</example>

## Coding Style Preferences

1. Prefer returning from a function vs nesting ifs
2. Prefer descriptive variable names over comments
