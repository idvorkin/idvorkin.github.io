# Cursor Rule Creation and Modification

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Context
- Cursor prevents direct creation or modification of .mdc rule files
- This rule provides a workaround to create and modify rule files
- Use this process whenever you need to create or update Cursor rules

## Rule Details

### Creating New Rule Files

Since Cursor prevents direct creation of .mdc files, follow this process:

1. **Create a temporary markdown file** with the rule content:
   ```bash
   touch temp-rule-file.md
   ```

2. **Edit the temporary file** with your rule content following the standard format:
   ```bash
   # Edit the file with your preferred editor or through Cursor
   ```

3. **Copy the temporary file to .mdc extension**:
   ```bash
   cp temp-rule-file.md .cursor/rules/XXX-rule-name.mdc
   ```
   - Replace `XXX` with appropriate numbering (e.g., 000, 100, etc.)
   - Use descriptive rule names with hyphens between words

4. **Clean up the temporary file**:
   ```bash
   rm temp-rule-file.md
   ```

### Modifying Existing Rule Files

To modify an existing rule file:

1. **Copy the existing rule to a temporary file**:
   ```bash
   cp .cursor/rules/XXX-rule-name.mdc temp-edit-rule.md
   ```

2. **Edit the temporary file** with your changes:
   ```bash
   # Make your edits to the temporary file
   ```

3. **Copy the temporary file back to the original location**:
   ```bash
   cp temp-edit-rule.md .cursor/rules/XXX-rule-name.mdc
   ```

4. **Clean up the temporary file**:
   ```bash
   rm temp-edit-rule.md
   ```

## Rule Format Requirements

Ensure your rule files follow this structure:

```
---
description: ACTION when TRIGGER to OUTCOME
globs: pattern(s)
tags: [tag1, tag2]
priority: 1-5
version: Major.Minor.Patch
---

# Rule Title

<version>X.Y.Z</version>

## Context
- When to apply this rule
- Prerequisites or conditions

## Rule Details
- Specific instructions
- Examples

## Additional Sections
- Any other relevant information
```

## Best Practices

1. **Numbering Convention**:
   - 000-099: Core system rules
   - 100-399: Project-specific rules
   - 400-699: Language/framework specific rules
   - 900-999: Documentation and process rules

2. **Version Management**:
   - Update the version number when modifying rules
   - Follow semantic versioning (Major.Minor.Patch)
   - Ensure version in frontmatter matches version tag in content

3. **Description Format**:
   - Start with an action verb (USE, ENFORCE, FOLLOW)
   - Include when to apply the rule
   - End with the expected outcome
