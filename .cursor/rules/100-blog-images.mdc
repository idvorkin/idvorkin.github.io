# Blog Image Management Standards

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Context
- When adding images to blog posts
- When managing existing blog images
- When updating image references

## Requirements

1. Image Location Verification
   - Check existing images in ~/rare_gits/blob/blog/
   - Verify if image already exists before adding new ones

2. Image Format Standards
   - Use .webp format for optimal performance
   - Use descriptive filenames indicating content
   - Store in ~/rare_gits/blob/blog/ directory

3. Front Matter Image Feature
   - Check for existing imagefeature in front matter
   - If missing, add using first image:
     ```yaml
     imagefeature: https://github.com/idvorkin/blob/raw/master/blog/your-image-name.webp
     ```
   - Preserve existing imagefeature if present

4. Image Include Usage
   - Use appropriate include based on layout needs:
     ```markdown
     {% include blob_image_float_right.html src="blog/image-name.webp" %}
     {% include blob_image.html src="blog/image-name.webp" %}
     ```
   - Prefer right-floating images unless specific layout requires centered

5. Image Placement
   - New posts: After first paragraph
   - Existing posts: Near relevant content
   - Maintain blank lines before and after include

6. Version Control
   - Commit new images to blob repo
   - Commit blog post changes
   - Ensure both repos are synchronized

## Examples

<example>
# Good Practice: Adding New Image

---
title: My Blog Post
imagefeature: https://github.com/idvorkin/blob/raw/master/blog/meditation-garden.webp
---

First paragraph introducing the topic.

{% include blob_image_float_right.html src="blog/meditation-garden.webp" %}

Content continues with image properly placed...
