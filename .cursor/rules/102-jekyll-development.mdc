# Jekyll Development Standards

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Context
- When developing blog posts locally
- When testing changes
- When managing includes and templates

## Requirements

1. Local Development Setup
   - Jekyll must be running locally on port 4000
   - Use localhost for all testing

2. Post Preview
   - Get permalink from post's front matter
   - Use standard preview command:
     ```bash
     open http://localhost:4000{permalink}
     ```

3. Section Preview
   - Append anchor to permalink for specific sections:
     ```bash
     open http://localhost:4000{permalink}#{anchor}
     ```
   - Anchors must match heading IDs

4. Include Management
   - Available includes:
     - blob_image.html
     - blob_image_float_right.html
     - amazon.html
     - alert.html
     - summarize-page.html
   - Verify includes work locally before committing

5. Terminal Commands
   - Append ` | /bin/cat` for pager commands
   - Run long-running commands in background
   - Use proper shell paths

## Examples

<example>
# Good Practice: Local Development

1. Start Jekyll server:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

2. Preview full post:
   ```bash
   open http://localhost:4000/learning
   ```

3. Preview specific section:
   ```bash
   open http://localhost:4000/learning#practice-methods
   ```

4. Test include:
   ```markdown
   {% include alert.html content="Test message" style="info" %}
   ```
</example>

# Anti-Pattern: Poor Development Practice

1. Direct file editing without preview
2. Using production URLs for testing
3. Not using proper command formatting:
   ```bash
   git log # Missing | /bin/cat
   ```
</example>
