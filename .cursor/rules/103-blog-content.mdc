# Blog Content Writing Standards

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Context
- When creating new blog content
- When editing existing content
- When adding references and citations

## Requirements

1. Content Preparation
   - Review back-links.json for context
   - Check for existing content:
     ```bash
     qa_blog where "your exact question in quotes"
     ```
   - Study example posts:
     - _posts/2020-04-01-Igor-Eulogy.md
     - _d/pride.md

2. Book References
   - Analyze blog themes for relevant books
   - Check existing amazon.html includes
   - Get ASIN for books:
     ```bash
     tony search "What is the ASIN for [book title]? Search Amazon too"
     ```
   - Use amazon.html include:
     ```markdown
     {% include amazon.html asin="ASIN1;ASIN2;ASIN3" %}
     ```

3. Content Summarization
   - Use summarize-page include for related content:
     ```markdown
     {% include summarize-page.html src="/page-url" %}
     ```
   - Verify permalinks in back-links.json
   - Place summaries strategically in content

4. Alert Usage
   - Use alert includes for important information:
     ```markdown
     {% include alert.html content="Message" style="style-name" %}
     ```
   - Available styles: primary, secondary, success, danger, warning, info, light, dark
   - Place alerts near relevant content

5. Writing Style Guidelines
   - Fun and quirky tone
   - Technical but accessible
   - No emojis
   - Professional formatting
   - Clear section organization

## Examples

{% include amazon.html asin="B001ANYDAO;B00506CSDQ" %}

The concepts from these books form the foundation of our discussion...

{% include alert.html content="Remember: Practice makes permanent, not perfect!" style="warning" %}

For more on deliberate practice, see our guide:
{% include summarize-page.html src="/deliberate-practice" %}
