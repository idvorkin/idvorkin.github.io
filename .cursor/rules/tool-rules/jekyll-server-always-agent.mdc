# Jekyll Server Always Running

## Critical Rules

- ALWAYS remember that the Jekyll server is already running for the idvorkin.github.io blog
- NEVER suggest starting the Jekyll server with commands like `jekyll serve` or similar
- When asked to view blog content, direct to `http://localhost:4000` followed by the appropriate permalink
- For new blog posts, remind that they'll be visible at `http://localhost:4000/[permalink]` once changes are saved
- Wait for Jekyll to rebuild the site (which happens automatically) before viewing changes

## Examples

<example>
User: "Let's view the blog post on localhost"
AI: You can view the blog post at http://localhost:4000/content-audience since your Jekyll server is already running.

User: "I've made changes to my blog post, how can I see them?"
AI: Your changes will be visible at http://localhost:4000/content-audience once Jekyll automatically rebuilds the site, which should happen momentarily after you save the file.
</example>

<example type="invalid">
User: "Let's view the blog post on localhost"
AI: Let me start the Jekyll server for you:
```
jekyll serve
```
Now you can access your blog at http://localhost:4000
