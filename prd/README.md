# Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)

This directory contains Product Requirements Documents for various features and systems in Igor's blog.

## Purpose

PRDs serve as comprehensive documentation for:

- Feature specifications and requirements
- Implementation roadmaps and epic structures
- Success criteria and performance metrics
- Technical architecture and dependencies
- Future enhancement planning

## Current PRDs

### [Sunburst Interactive Prompts](./sunburst-interactive-prompts.md)

Interactive visualization system that transforms hierarchical content into clickable sunburst charts with contextual prompt generation.

**Status**: Draft  
**Current Epic**: Enhanced User Experience  
**Key Features**: Plotly.js sunburst charts, click interactions, random prompt generation

## PRD Standards

All PRDs in this directory follow the standardized format defined in `.cursor/rules/901-prd.mdc`:

1. **Header**: Clear title and status
2. **Introduction**: Project overview and context
3. **Goals**: Objectives, success criteria, and KPIs
4. **Features and Requirements**: Functional, non-functional, UX, integration, and compliance requirements
5. **Epic Structure**: Sequential implementation phases
6. **Story List**: Granular tasks organized by epic
7. **Future Enhancements**: Long-term vision and potential features

## Contributing

When creating new PRDs:

1. Follow the standardized template structure
2. Use clear, measurable success criteria
3. Define epics sequentially (only one "Current" epic at a time)
4. Break down stories into implementable chunks
5. Include technical architecture details
6. Document dependencies and integration requirements

## Epic and Story Management

- **Epics**: Major feature sets or functionality areas
- **Stories**: Granular, implementable tasks within epics
- **Status Tracking**: Complete → Current → Future
- **Sequential Implementation**: Complete one epic before starting the next
