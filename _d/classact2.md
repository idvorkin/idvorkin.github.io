## The practices

### Seek first to understand

{%include summarize-page.html src="/7h-c5" %}

### Be compassionate

{%include summarize-page.html src="/compassion" %}

### Appreciate

{%include summarize-page.html src="/appreciate" %}

### Do something touching

Not quite the same, but pretty related

{%include summarize-page.html src="/touching" %}

### Other

- Never speak about someone behind their back what you wouldn't say to their face.
- Why you want to [dismiss others](https://sive.rs/dis), feels good, feel superior, easy.

## Great Examples

### Not taking the bait.

Steve Jobs not being baited by an insult.

Bill Gates not being baited to complain about the government response to covid

- Interviewer: Trying to Stir a rage answer on why wasted on February
- Bill Gates: OK, we didn't act, but the good news is "focus on productive action"

Everything Mr. Rogers does

### Being a leader

This chef as he praises other, focuses on the customer, trains other. And the respect he is commanded as a result - so good...
