## The practices

### Seek first to understand

{%include summarize-page.html src="/7h-c5" %}

### Be compassionate

{%include summarize-page.html src="/compassion" %}

### Appreciate

{%include summarize-page.html src="/appreciate" %}

### Do something touching

Not quite the same, but pretty related

### Other

- Never speak about someone behind their back what you wouldn't say to their face.

## Great Examples

### Not taking the bait.

Steve Jobs not being baited by an insult.

Bill Gates not being baited to complain about the government response to covid

Everything Mr. Rogers does

### Being a leader
