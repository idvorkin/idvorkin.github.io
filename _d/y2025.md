I like to begin in mind, so let's write a report for 2025. This hasn't happened, but if I don't write it out and focus on it, it certainly won't.

### Major Projects

#### What I wish I knew at 42

{% include alert.html type="danger" content="**2025 Result:** No progress. Carrying forward to 2026." %}

Carrying this forward from 2024, with renewed focus. This year I'll be 47, and the lessons keep coming. Time to capture and share them.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/42" %}
{%include summarize-page.html src="/chapters" %}

### Content Creation: Building Your Legacy in Real-Time

{% include alert.html type="warning" content="**2025 Result:** Mixed. Made lots of videos and had fun doing it. Got really good at [CapCut](/content-creation). The Fortune Cookie series launched but EM content didn't make it to TikTok." %}

Finally getting intentional about content creation. Started some new series like Igor Fortune Cookie (life wisdom in 60 seconds) and documenting my experiments with AI agents. The goal isn't viral fame—it's leaving breadcrumbs for my kids and anyone else who finds value in the journey.

{% include youtube_playlist.html list="PLJveOxX-mxxBsIsk83fr0sb3i7RdpaJbF" %}

{% include summarize-page.html src="/content-audience" %}

#### EM Handbook: TikTok Edition

{% include alert.html type="danger" content="**2025 Result:** Didn't happen. Try again in 2026." %}

Taking the content developed in 2024 and transforming it into engaging, bite-sized TikTok content. The goal is to make engineering management wisdom accessible and entertaining. Key focus areas:

- Making PSCs and calibrations stress-free through better preparation and mindset
- Breaking down complex management topics into digestible chunks
- Sharing real-world examples and stories

{%include summarize-page.html src="/manager-book" %}
{%include summarize-page.html src="/content-creation" %}

#### AI Projects

{% include alert.html type="success" content="**2025 Result:** Crushed it. 59 CHOP sessions logged, tons of new tools built. See [How Igor CHOPs](/how-igor-chops) for the full workflow." %}

Building on the success of [CHOP and CHOW](/chop) in 2024, focusing on:

- Enhancing Tony (my Tesla companion)
- Developing new AI tools for productivity
- Exploring novel applications of LLMs

{%include summarize-page.html src="/chop" %}

### Summer Vacation

{% include alert.html type="success" content="**2025 Result:** Solid. Had a blast." %}

Planning another memorable family vacation, building on the success of 2024's adventures.

### Goals

#### Physical Health

{% include alert.html type="success" content="**2025 Result:** Very strong ending - sleep consistent, gym recovered, kettlebells progressing. Except for a last-minute shoulder injury in late December." %}

Late December shoulder injury - see [shoulder pain](/shoulder-pain) for recovery plan.

Building on 2024's foundation of consistent early rising and gym attendance, moving into maintenance mode on most of my strength goals.

#### Emotional Health

{% include alert.html type="warning" content="**2025 Result:** Started strong but practices eroded. Restarted meditation and journalling on 12/30 - carrying that momentum into 2026." %}

| Metric        | Goal     | Jan      | June       | Dec              | Status              |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |

| Gratefulness  | Daily    | Daily    | 2-3 d/week | Sporadic         | Needs rebuild       |

#### Magic

{% include alert.html type="warning" content="**2025 Result:** Meh. Learned the new tricks I wanted, but barely performed. Need to push myself to get in front of strangers." %}

Time to truly revive the magic practice. Focus on:

- Regular performance for strangers
- Building a new repertoire
- Incorporating AI for practice tracking and improvement

#### Identity Health

{% include alert.html type="warning" content="**2025 Result:** Tony won on biking. But goofy shirts and mismatched crocs going strong! Ballooning weak - at my best I did balloons while travelling." %}

- Biking: Get back on the bike despite the Tesla temptation
- New hobbies: Explore one new identity-expanding activity

## Stuff I'm really proud of

**Relationship with Tori** - Made a deliberate effort to improve our relationship, and it worked. Intentional investment in what matters most.

**Gap year thinking** - Worked through what it would look like to not be working. With the kids getting older and economic uncertainty, this mental preparation gives peace of mind. The [Igor's Gap Year](/igor-gap-year) post became my most-edited file of the year (38 changes).

**Continued AI investment** - Kept building with AI tools, which brings genuine joy. [CHOP](/chop) sessions, [Tony the Tesla](/tesla), new productivity tools.

**Zach's spiritual journey** - Zach got into religion and I got to explore alongside him. The 27 changes to [Walking with God](/walking-with-god) reflect real engagement, not just observation.

**Amelia coming into her own** - Watching her develop her identity. The highlight: overhearing her tell a friend, "Yeah, he's a little weird, but he's actually pretty cool." Peak parenting achievement unlocked.

**Mom's 75th birthday** - Flew down to celebrate with her. Also reconnected with my cousin for the first time in 30 years (all credit to him for making it happen).
