I like to begin in mind, so let's write a report for 2025. This hasn't happened, but if I don't write it out and focus on it, it certainly won't.

### Major Projects

#### What I wish I knew at 42

Carrying this forward from 2024, with renewed focus. This year I'll be 47, and the lessons keep coming. Time to capture and share them.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/chapters" %}

### Content Creation: Building Your Legacy in Real-Time

Finally getting intentional about content creation. Started some new series like Igor Fortune Cookie (life wisdom in 60 seconds) and documenting my experiments with AI agents. The goal isn't viral fame—it's leaving breadcrumbs for my kids and anyone else who finds value in the journey.

{% include summarize-page.html src="/content-audience" %}

#### EM Handbook: TikTok Edition

Taking the content developed in 2024 and transforming it into engaging, bite-sized TikTok content. The goal is to make engineering management wisdom accessible and entertaining. Key focus areas:

- Making PSCs and calibrations stress-free through better preparation and mindset
- Breaking down complex management topics into digestible chunks
- Sharing real-world examples and stories

#### AI Projects

Building on the success of [CHOP and CHOW](/chop) in 2024, focusing on:

- Enhancing Tony (my Tesla companion)
- Developing new AI tools for productivity
- Exploring novel applications of LLMs

### Summer Vacation

Planning another memorable family vacation, building on the success of 2024's adventures.
