### Choose yourself:

- Old world:
  _ huge barriers to distribution (shelf space, book publishers)
  _ Perfect was hard to find/expensive.
- New world
  : Free distribution (amazon/kindle/youtube)
  : Perfection is free (high fidelity recording)

- If you can be chosen by legacy distribution channel - GREAT.
- Alternate, do your thing, and your tribe will find you.

### Your Value: Execution (Cog) vs Tribe Building:

- Industry/Corporations designed to survive loss of a cog. Choose folks who are best cogs.
- Cogs by definition are replaceable.
- Two types of work: Exceptional execution vs Tribe Builders
  - Execution - best cog there is. Support a connection build.
  - Tribe builders - focus on trust and attention.
- Cog vs Leader
- Cog is cheap, pumped out more effectively, Access to 10 billion people, working for free. 10 billion people a problem.
- Tribe Leader - Find and build a tribe, of people who choose you. You get access to 10 Billion.
- Tribe Leader - Strategy: Do what only you can do, really reduces competition for possible tribe leader.

### Your tribe:

- Who is your tribe?
- Chooses you because you earn their trust, and are worthy of their attention.
- Provide attention because there is tension
- Doesn't care about perfection,
- When you find your thing, and your tribe finds you, you tune to appeal, so long as it still appeals to your thing.
- Your tribe does X, because X is what people like them do.
- Tribe(Fans) vs Friends:
  - Friend - Wants to know you, and see your art to make YOU happy. If you change your art, they're there for you.
  - Tribe - Wants your art, doesn't care about you, unless grows appreciate of your art.
  - Change your art: lose your tribe, keep your friends.
- Once you've found your tribe, give them art they'll tell their friends/family about.
- Wants personal attention - wants to feel special.

### Connection:

- People prefer selfies to signed books
- Make experiences people want to tell their friends/families about.
- Give people a story they can tell others [TBD:Link - why is noone referring my project]
- Story/Context is how people connect.
- Perfection blocks connection, as not accessible. Rough feels good, and accessible.
- Enjoyment of amateur vs pro - there is tension that can be failure.

### Tourists vs Tribe:

- Funnel - Tourists at top, tribe at bottom.
- Reduce enrollment cost for tourists - low cost, bite size nuggets.
- Increase value for tribe - longer/more expensive.
- Enrollment: Need to invest into enrollment - funnel optimization Tourist -> Tribe Member

#### Anchoring/Postioning:

- Careful how you ask for feedback/position yourself.
- Give me feedback on my ppt -> feedback on ppt.
- I want to get this point across => Don't make a ppt, do a memo!
- DON'T BREAK INTO JAIL.
- DON'T START WITH SOLUTION, START WITH PROBLEM.
- PROVIDE CONTEXT, problem statement.

### Expectations:

- Questions:
  - What industry expectations are blocking your art?
  - What expectations does your tribe have of you?
- What makes your tribe your tribe vs What protects the industry.
  - Your tribe: expect you to swear
  - Industry: Taxi's should be regulated, full time, and a monopoly.
  - If industry expectation is a problem shatter it.

### The DIP:

- See [the dip](/the-dip)
- Questions:
  - Should I quit, or lean in?
  - Am I in a Dip vs Cul DeSac?
  - What do I need to get through the DIP?
- Dips vs cull desac.
  - DIP prevents others from doing your thing.
  - Cul de'sac is a dead end.
  - Single people/small group is often a cul desac.
  - Need to find 1000 people of the whole world - DIP
  - Need to change mind of 5 specific people, probably cul de sac.
- Quitting:
  - You only get 1000 units of energy in your life.
  - You'll need 600 units to break through a dip, quit things that aren't moving you forward.
- Quit before the DIP, but not in the DIP, too expensive
- Need to quit lots of things,
- To get through the DIP, need to lean in.
