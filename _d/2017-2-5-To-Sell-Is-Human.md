Selling matters - it's pitching, convincing, negotiating, hiring. Selling has a bad rap, because the seller often puts their needs ahead of the buyer - a win/lose paradigm. You should make selling [win/win or no deal](/7h-c4) by needing to answer yes to these questions. 1/ If the buyer agrees, will their life improve? 2/ When the deal is done, will the world be a better place than when you began?

[To sell is human](https://www.amazon.com/Sell-Human-Surprising-Moving-Others-ebook/dp/B0087GJ8KM/) is a treatise on the modern form of sales. Part I describes why selling is important, and how it has evolved. Part II focuses on the how to be a salesman and Part III focuses on what you need to do to do sales.

### Pitch

As you prepare your pitch, whichever variety you choose, clarify your purpose and strategy by making sure you can answer these three questions: After someone hears your pitch . . .

- What do you want them to know?
- What do you want them to feel?
- What do you want them to do?

| Pitch Tip    | How                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| One Word     | Write a fifty-word pitch. Reduce it to twenty-five words. Then to six words. One of those remaining half-dozen is almost certainly your one-word pitch                                                                                 |
| The Question | Use this if your arguments are strong. If they're weak, make a statement. Or better yet, find some new arguments                                                                                                                       |
| Rhyming      | Don't rack your brain for rhymes. Go online and find a rhyming dictionary. I'm partial to [RhymeZone](http:// www.rhymezone.com)                                                                                                       |
| Subject Line | Review the subject lines of the last twenty e-mail messages you've sent. Note how many of them appeal to either utility or curiosity. If that number is less than ten, rewrite each one that fails the test.                           |
| Twitter      | Even though Twitter allows 140 characters, limit your pitch to 120 characters so that others can pass it on. Remember: The best pitches are short, sweet, and easy to retweet                                                          |
| Pixar        | Read all twenty-two of former [Pixar story artist Emma Coats's story rules](http:// bit.ly/ jlVWrG) Your try: Once upon a time [..] . Every day, [..]. One day [..] . Because of that [..] . Because of that [..]. Until finally [..]. |

### Improvise

Improv teaches valuable skills for sales, and maps to many topics on this blog

- Hear Offers ... [Seek First to Understand](/7h-c5)
- Yes And ... [Getting to Yes](/gty)
- Make your partner look good ... [Think win/win](/7h-c4)

### Serve

Service is about improving others lives, and in the process improving the world.

- Make it personal
  - Radiologists seeing a picture of a person, do a better job
  - See patients as people instead of bundles of symptoms.
  - Professionalism _does not mean_ cold and distant, it means human connection.
  - Put your personal brand behind what you're doing (put your phone number on your product)
- Make it purposeful
  - People aren't just selfish, they feel great when they help others.
  - Washing helps stop patients from getting sick, much more effective than washing hands kills germs.
- Upserve don't upsell.
  - How can I provide even more value in this experience?
  - Always imagine the other guy is doing you a favor.
- Emotionally Intelligent signs:
  - Don't worry - the line moves quickly. (give empathy)
  - Children play here - pick up after your dog (provide purpose)
