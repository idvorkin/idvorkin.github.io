Getting Things Done (GTD) is a model based on David Allen's book of the same name. It's a deep dive into Habit 3 - first things first, with some lite weight Habit 2 - begin with the end in mind, mixed in for good measure. By using GTD religiously you can have a drastic reduction in stress and procrastination.

## Theory

### Open loops and Psychic Weight

Open loops are caused by your brain continuing to think of an open issue when you don't want it to. Open loops are [psychic weight](/psychic-weight) and are a great source of [anxiety](/anxiety). By getting your open-loops capture into a system your brain trusts, your brain can stop thinking about this.

### Activation Energy and Procrastination

### Thinking vs Doing Next Actions

It's easy to [procrastinate](/procrastinate) when the next action isn't clear

## Practices

### Capture

Your brain is terrible at remembering stuff, often forgetting the important, and dwelling on the un-actionable. As soon as a thought/task comes in, add it to your inbox

### Triage - Drop; Do; Delegate; Defer

All incoming tasks should handled by one of the four workflows and ignored from that point forward:

- Drop - Best case :) See [Essentialism](/essentialism) and [the dip](/dip)
- Do - If it takes less then 2 minutes, [get it done](/frog). Otherwise the overhead is too high.
- Delegate - Get someone else to do it, [outsourcing](/outsourcing) is great.
- Defer - Convert it into a "next action", words you'll understand later context free, and add it to a project

### Power Hour - Grind

When you get a reasonable chunk of time, crack open a project, and grind through the next actions.

### Weekly Review

To make sure your brain trusts the system, and doesn't [recreate open loops](/idle-loop), it needs to know what's in your system will be good and not lost. Use a weekly review to go through your projects and see if anything needs to be done urgently.

## Software

Here's some software that I've used. None is perfect for me (I'm not sure what would be perfect), which is a shame. I think the best advice I have is, it doesn't matter what you use, it matters that you use it. I'll tell you when I find my perfect system.

### OmniFocus

Primarily Apple, and incredibly complicated (aka powerful). The complexity is easy to get lost in, but really nice UX, and lots of good features. It has a web interface, but it's amazing on the mac, less so on Windows.

### Nozbe

Multiplatform was best in class in 2012 when it was created, but hasn't had many upgrades since. I used it for years.
