Welcome to The CHOW Kitchen! CHOW - or Chat-Oriented Writing - is transforming how we create content. Think of those bustling restaurant kitchens: AI started as the prep cook, chopping vegetables and measuring ingredients. Then it became a line cook, helping with recipes and plating. Now? It's becoming a sous chef, capable of crafting entire dishes from your creative vision. Our AIs are getting more sophisticated daily, and we'll explore how to make the most of this culinary revolution in writing.

The concept emerged from the realization that traditional writing processes are being transformed by Large Language Models (LLMs). As these models become more sophisticated at tasks like research, outlining, and even drafting, the role of the writer shifts towards higher-level creative direction and refinement. This isn't just about AI replacing basic writing tasks - it's about a new way of working where writers who embrace CHOW can achieve significant productivity boosts while maintaining their unique voice and vision.

## The Foundations of CHOW

Before we explore how AI transforms writing, let's understand the foundations that CHOW builds upon. After all, even the most sophisticated AI kitchen needs to understand the basics of cooking!

### The Art of Writing

### Key Tools

The landscape of AI writing tools is evolving rapidly. Rather than provide a potentially outdated list of specific tools, I'll update this section periodically with current best practices and tool recommendations. The key is to focus on the principles and patterns of CHOW, which can be applied regardless of which specific AI assistant you're using.

For now, experiment with the major AI platforms (you know the ones), and find what works best for your writing style and needs. Remember: the best tool is the one that helps you maintain your creative vision while enhancing your productivity.

## CHOW and the Four Writing Personas

Writing breaks down into four distinct phases, each with its own persona: the Madman, Architect, Carpenter, and Judge. AI can be a powerful partner in each phase, enhancing your natural abilities while maintaining your creative control. Let's explore how CHOW can amplify each role:

### The Madman and AI: Unleashing Creative Chaos

The Madman phase is all about uninhibited brainstorming and idea generation. Here's how AI can enhance your creative madness:

- **Prompt Storming**: Use AI to generate multiple angles on your topic

  - "Show me 10 different ways to approach this topic"
  - "What are some unconventional perspectives on this?"
    o
  - "Help me explore the extreme edges of this idea"

- **Idea Expansion**: Let AI help you go deeper into each thought

  - Feed it your raw ideas and ask for related concepts
  - Use it to find surprising connections between topics
  - Ask it to play "what if" with your concepts

- **Research Assistant**: While you're in creative flow, AI can:
  - Find relevant quotes and references
  - Suggest related topics to explore
  - Gather supporting evidence for your ideas

Remember: In this phase, quantity beats quality. Let both your mind and the AI run wild.

### The Architect and AI: Structuring Your Thoughts

The Architect phase is about organizing your chaos into coherent structure. AI can help by:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Feed it your Madman output and ask:

  - "What themes do you see in these ideas?"
  - "How might we organize these thoughts?"
  - "What's the most logical flow for these concepts?"

- **Outline Generation**: Work with AI to:

  - Create multiple possible outlines
  - Test different organizational frameworks
  - Identify gaps in your structure

- **Audience Analysis**: Use AI to consider:
  - How different readers might approach your content
  - What background knowledge they'll need
  - Where you might need more context or explanation

### The Carpenter and AI: Crafting Your Words

In the Carpenter phase, you're building your first draft. AI can be your assistant by:

- **Draft Collaboration**:

  - Generate initial sections based on your outline
  - Suggest transitions between ideas
  - Offer alternative phrasings

- **Style Consistency**:

  - Help maintain your voice throughout
  - Check for tone consistency
  - Suggest improvements while preserving your style

- **Enhancement Suggestions**:
  - Identify places for examples or analogies
  - Suggest where to add data or quotes
  - Recommend areas that need more detail

### The Judge and AI: Polishing Your Work

The Judge phase is about critical review and refinement. AI can help by:

- **Technical Review**:

  - Check grammar and style
  - Identify repetitive phrases
  - Ensure consistent terminology

- **Content Analysis**:

  - Verify logical flow
  - Check for gaps in argumentation
  - Ensure all claims are supported

- **Reader Perspective**:
  - Simulate different reader reactions
  - Identify potential points of confusion
  - Suggest clarifications where needed

### Key Principles for AI-Enhanced Writing

1. **Keep the Phases Separate**:

   - Don't let AI's capabilities tempt you to mix phases
   - Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - Use different prompts for different phases

2. **Maintain Creative Control**:

   - AI is your assistant, not your replacement
   - Use AI to enhance your ideas, not generate them entirely
   - Trust your instincts when AI suggestions don't feel right

3. **Iterate with Purpose**:
   - Use AI feedback to improve each phase
   - Don't get stuck in endless refinement
   - Know when to move forward

## Real-World Use Cases

Here are some examples of how I use CHOW in my daily writing:

### Updating Book References On My Blog

My blog has many posts that link to Amazon posts: For example [Designing Data Systems](/td/data-systems).
I added the link to that book [using AI](https://github.com/idvorkin/idvorkin.github.io/commit/e2322fb5e93943bf06c5cbefb6d56aa4462d69b8). You can see the chat transcript [here](https://gist.github.com/idvorkin/0f8ae3ab7c6fb762820c08ced4b2cefa)

This is possible due to the [conventions](https://github.com/idvorkin/idvorkin.github.io/blob/e2322fb5e93943bf06c5cbefb6d56aa4462d69b8/CONVENTIONS.md?plain=1#L234). Note, I'll find another example where it uses search to find the right ASIN to include.

### Adding Security Considerations to Technical Documentation

A great example of CHOW in action is adding a security considerations section to the [CHOP documentation](https://github.com/idvorkin/idvorkin.github.io/commit/45241b48cde0b00af27f5e824f44c9c334d0e048).

I told the AI ([full convo](https://github.com/idvorkin/idvorkin.github.io/blob/45241b48cde0b00af27f5e824f44c9c334d0e048/cursor-logs/updating-chop-post-avoiding-secret-uploads.md)): And then it made [this change](https://github.com/idvorkin/idvorkin.github.io/commit/45241b48cde0b00af27f5e824f44c9c334d0e048#diff-61c44102203643ae4e0a122c0cac217a54cc9ddaf421e06d5be6c417747ab1c9)

```
update chop post to talk about being careful to not upload secrets in your history. For example:

I had to add verbose logging to my integration tests, and that showed a secret, which was in my cursor logs. Then I went to upload my cursor logs to have a historical record. Thankfully github detected it on push:

See it here: @https://gist.github.com/idvorkin/ff8ac2d79a95330aa708a37809672e4e

And maybe inline some relevant chunks of that.
```

A few things to notice:

- It read the gist to understand the content I wanted to write about itsel
- Placed the section logically in the document flow
- Added appropriate table of contents entries
- Maintained consistent voice and style
- Maintained consistent formatting with existing content

## Deep ideas

### Generating the content for the reader

The author now provides the raw content, and it can create content on demand optimized for the reader, which can include pivots like:

- Should it be interactive
- What age level to write for
- What interests does the read have.
- What format (text, tweet, video, audio)

Aerial talks about this nicely [here](https://gist.github.com/idvorkin/3cb3d50a175d3b2879ad537678704619#file-think-md)

For computer folks this is like [write path vs read path in data systems](/td/data-systems#write-path-vs-read-path)

### New monetization strategies

Instead of selling static assets (book, video) - you provide the content and it is generated for the reader.
