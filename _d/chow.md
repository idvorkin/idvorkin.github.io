I used to stare at blank pages. Now I have a different problem: AI will happily fill those pages for me, but my brain stays empty. CHOW - Chat-Oriented Writing - is my answer: using AI to think better, not just write faster. The written artifact is a side effect. The real product is clarity in your head. This post covers why writing equals thinking, the risk of outsourcing that thinking to AI, and the four thinking modes - Madman, Architect, Carpenter, Judge - that help you partner with AI instead of just delegating to it.

{% include alert.html content="I use the word 'writing' instead of 'thinking' because telling people 'I'm going to help you think better' causes them to go 'Oh my gosh, I forgot!

## CHOW is Thinking

### Why Writing = Thinking

{% include summarize-page.html src="/writing" %}

The act of putting ideas into words forces clarity. Vague notions that feel profound in your head reveal themselves as muddled when you try to explain them. This is why writing matters - not for the artifact, but for the thinking it produces.

CHOW builds on the principles of Chat-Oriented Programming (CHOP):

### The Risk: Outsourcing Your Thinking

AI makes writing easy. That's the obvious part. The less obvious part: the thinking that writing forced on you - the struggle to clarify, to find the gap in your logic, to articulate what you actually mean - that was the point.

When AI writes for you, you skip the struggle. And the struggle was doing the work.

This is why CHOW matters. The goal isn't "get AI to write stuff." The goal is "use AI to think better." The difference:

| Outsourcing                     | Partnering                                         |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| "Write me a blog post about X"  | "Help me figure out what I actually think about X" |
| AI generates, you approve       | AI challenges, you clarify                         |
| Words appear, thinking optional | Thinking required, words are the receipt           |

### For You vs. For Them

Every piece of writing serves two audiences:

**For You (Understanding)** - Writing to figure out what you actually think. The reader is future-you or maybe no one. The goal is clarity in your own head.

**For Them (Being Understood)** - Writing to transfer understanding to someone else. The reader is a real audience. The goal is clarity in their head.

These aren't separate activities - they're interleaved. You can't explain something clearly until you understand it yourself. And the act of trying to explain often reveals you didn't understand it as well as you thought.

AI can help with both, but you have to know which mode you're in.

## The Four Thinking Modes

The Madman, Architect, Carpenter, and Judge aren't just writing phases - they're thinking phases. Each serves two purposes: helping _you_ understand, and helping _others_ understand.

| Persona       | For You (Understanding)                                                            | For Them (Being Understood)                                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Madman**    | Explore what you're confused about, dump half-formed thoughts                      | Brainstorm what the reader needs, what angles might resonate       |
| **Architect** | Organize your own mental model, find gaps in your logic                            | Structure the reader's journey, decide what order they need things |
| **Carpenter** | Precision forces clarity - "I can't write this, so I don't actually understand it" | Choose words for the reader, craft sentences they'll follow        |
| **Judge**     | Poke holes in your own reasoning, find where you're fooling yourself               | Edit for clarity, catch what will confuse the reader               |

AI can be a powerful partner in each phase. Let's explore how:

### The Madman: Unleashing Creative Chaos

The Madman phase is all about uninhibited brainstorming and idea generation. Here's how AI can enhance your creative madness:

#### Prompt Storming

Use AI to generate multiple angles on your topic:

- "Show me 10 different ways to approach this topic"
- "What are some unconventional perspectives on this?"
- "Help me explore the extreme edges of this idea"

#### Idea Expansion

Let AI help you go deeper into each thought:

- Feed it your raw ideas and ask for related concepts
- Use it to find surprising connections between topics
- Ask it to play "what if" with your concepts

#### Research Assistant

While you're in creative flow, AI can:

- Find relevant quotes and references
- Suggest related topics to explore
- Gather supporting evidence for your ideas

Remember: In this phase, quantity beats quality. Let both your mind and the AI run wild.

### The Architect: Structuring Your Thoughts

The Architect phase is about organizing your chaos into coherent structure. AI can help by:

#### Pattern Recognition

Feed it your Madman output and ask:

- "What themes do you see in these ideas?"
- "How might we organize these thoughts?"
- "What's the most logical flow for these concepts?"

#### Outline Generation

Work with AI to:

- Create multiple possible outlines
- Test different organizational frameworks
- Identify gaps in your structure

**Examples**:

- Restructured my retirement guide's TOC using AI to improve flow and consistency - see the [conversation](https://github.com/idvorkin/idvorkin.github.io/blob/c58c85a628220e585f3211ca2d16baaa110b7851/chop-logs/enhancing-toc-consistency-for-retirement-guide.md) and [changes](https://github.com/idvorkin/idvorkin.github.io/commit/c58c85a628220e585f3211ca2d16baaa110b7851#diff-6cee02582eaf62a323c5d25f3fb08b32b208d286ca3b62efc2d41356700a1e14)
- Organized book references using consistent conventions - see the [changes](https://github.com/idvorkin/idvorkin.github.io/commit/e2322fb5e93943bf06c5cbefb6d56aa4462d69b8) and [conversation](https://gist.github.com/idvorkin/0f8ae3ab7c6fb762820c08ced4b2cefa)

#### Audience Analysis

Use AI to consider:

- How different readers might approach your content
- What background knowledge they'll need
- Where you might need more context or explanation

### The Carpenter: Crafting Your Words

In the Carpenter phase, you're building your first draft. AI can be your assistant by:

#### Draft Collaboration

Generate initial sections based on your outline:

- Generate initial sections based on your outline
- Suggest transitions between ideas
- Offer alternative phrasings

**Examples**:

- Added a security considerations section to CHOP documentation - see the [changes](https://github.com/idvorkin/idvorkin.github.io/commit/45241b48cde0b00af27f5e824f44c9c334d0e048#diff-61c44102203643ae4e0a122c0cac217a54cc9ddaf421e06d5be6c417747ab1c9) and [conversation](https://github.com/idvorkin/idvorkin.github.io/blob/45241b48cde0b00af27f5e824f44c9c334d0e048/cursor-logs/updating-chop-post-avoiding-secret-uploads.md)

#### Style Consistency

Help maintain your voice throughout:

- Help maintain your voice throughout
- Check for tone consistency
- Suggest improvements while preserving your style

#### Enhancement Suggestions

Identify areas for improvement:

- Identify places for examples or analogies
- Suggest where to add data or quotes
- Recommend areas that need more detail

### The Judge: Polishing Your Work

The Judge phase is about critical review and refinement. AI can help by:

#### Technical Review

Ensure technical accuracy and polish:

- Check grammar and style
- Identify repetitive phrases
- Ensure consistent terminology

#### Content Analysis

Verify the quality and flow of content:

- Verify logical flow
- Check for gaps in argumentation
- Ensure all claims are supported

#### Reader Perspective

Consider the audience's viewpoint:

- Simulate different reader reactions
- Identify potential points of confusion
- Suggest clarifications where needed

### Key Principles for AI-Enhanced Thinking

1. **Keep the Phases Separate**:
   - Don't let AI's capabilities tempt you to mix phases
   - Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - Use different prompts for different phases

2. **Maintain Creative Control**:
   - AI is your assistant, not your replacement
   - Use AI to enhance your ideas, not generate them entirely
   - Trust your instincts when AI suggestions don't feel right

3. **Iterate with Purpose**:
   - Use AI feedback to improve each phase
   - Don't get stuck in endless refinement
   - Know when to move forward

## The Art of the Back-and-Forth

The magic of CHOW isn't in what AI produces - it's in how you collaborate. Understanding this changes everything.

### Filtering Is Easier Than Creating

Here's the core insight: **your taste is the bottleneck, not your idea generation.**

Creating from scratch is hard. Staring at a blank page, pulling ideas from nothing - that's cognitively expensive. But looking at five options and saying "that one, but tweak it this way"? That's easy. Your brain is wired for pattern recognition and preference, not ex nihilo creation.

This flips the traditional writing process. Instead of:

1. Think hard → produce draft → revise

You get:

1. Describe what you want → AI proposes options → you filter and refine

The AI handles the generative load. You handle the taste. Both play to their strengths.

### The Collaboration Patterns

**AI proposes, you filter.** Ask for five alternatives, not one answer. "Give me 5 title options" beats "What should the title be?" Options give you material to react to.

**Fast loops over perfect proposals.** Short exchanges, quick iteration. Say "3" or "mix 2 and 5" and move on. Momentum matters more than getting each step perfect.

**Think out loud, let AI structure.** Verbalize half-formed ideas. "I want something about... maybe the feeling of... or like when you..." The AI catches these fragments and helps crystallize them.

**Refine, don't just accept.** AI suggestions are starting points. Take "For Real" and make it "For This Human." The magic happens in your refinement.

**Systematic sweeps.** Go through your piece methodically - every heading, every section. Focused decisions beat scattered attention.

### AI Slop vs. Human Sludge

Everyone complains about AI slop - that generic, over-enthusiastic, emoji-laden output that screams "a robot wrote this."

But have you looked at LinkedIn lately? Twitter? Any social media? **Human sludge is everywhere.** Corporate jargon. Passive voice. "Learnings" and "deliverables" and "at the end of the day." Humble-brag posts. Engagement-bait threads. Throat-clearing paragraphs that say nothing. Humans produce absolute garbage without any AI help.

Here's the thing: **AI can be a hell of a lot better than human sludge.** At least AI doesn't have ego getting in the way. It doesn't pad content to sound important. It doesn't write to impress rather than communicate.

The bar isn't "as good as a human." The bar is "as good as the actual content humans produce" - and that bar is surprisingly low.

But of course, the real value isn't replacing human sludge with AI slop. It's using AI to **augment**: take human sludge and make it good, or take high-quality human content and make it even better. That's what CHOW is actually about.

## Deep ideas

### Beyond Images: Interactive Visualizations as Apps

When you first think about AI-generated content, images come to mind. But why stop there? CHOW can generate interactive visualizations - essentially small apps that let readers explore ideas dynamically rather than passively consuming static content.

Consider the difference:

- **Static image**: A diagram showing how religions evolved
- **Interactive app**: An [explorer](https://religion-evolution-explorer.surge.sh/) where readers can click through religious traditions, see connections, and discover relationships themselves

Or:

- **Static text**: "This post was written 3 years ago"
- **Interactive widget**: A [timeline visualization](https://idvorkin-how-long-since-ai.surge.sh/?show=tool) showing exactly how old content is, updating in real-time

These aren't just prettier presentations - they're fundamentally different experiences. Interactive content lets readers:

- Explore at their own pace and interest level
- Discover insights you didn't explicitly write
- Engage more deeply with the material
- Return and find new things each time

The tooling for this is increasingly accessible: React, Vite, and modern JavaScript frameworks make it straightforward to create these micro-apps. CHOW can help you design and build them conversationally, turning your content ideas into interactive experiences.

### Generating the content for the reader

The author now provides the raw content, and it can create content on demand optimized for the reader, which can include pivots like:

- Should it be interactive
- What age level to write for
- What interests does the read have.
- What format (text, tweet, video, audio)

Aerial talks about this nicely [here](https://gist.github.com/idvorkin/3cb3d50a175d3b2879ad537678704619#file-think-md)

For computer folks this is like [write path vs read path in data systems](/td/data-systems#write-path-vs-read-path)

### New monetization strategies

Instead of selling static assets (book, video) - you provide the content and it is generated for the reader.
