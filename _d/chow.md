Welcome to The CHOW Kitchen! CHOW - or Chat-Oriented Writing - is transforming how we create content. Think of those bustling restaurant kitchens: AI started as the prep cook, chopping vegetables and measuring ingredients. Then it became a line cook, helping with recipes and plating. Now? It's becoming a sous chef, capable of crafting entire dishes from your creative vision. Our AIs are getting more sophisticated daily, and we'll explore how to make the most of this culinary revolution in writing.

The concept emerged from the realization that traditional writing processes are being transformed by Large Language Models (LLMs). As these models become more sophisticated at tasks like research, outlining, and even drafting, the role of the writer shifts towards higher-level creative direction and refinement. This isn't just about AI replacing basic writing tasks - it's about a new way of working where writers who embrace CHOW can achieve significant productivity boosts while maintaining their unique voice and vision.

### Key Tools

The landscape of AI writing tools is evolving rapidly. Rather than provide a potentially outdated list of specific tools, I'll update this section periodically with current best practices and tool recommendations. The key is to focus on the principles and patterns of CHOW, which can be applied regardless of which specific AI assistant you're using.

For now, experiment with the major AI platforms (you know the ones), and find what works best for your writing style and needs. Remember: the best tool is the one that helps you maintain your creative vision while enhancing your productivity.

## CHOW and the Four Writing Personas

Writing breaks down into four distinct phases, each with its own persona: the Madman, Architect, Carpenter, and Judge. AI can be a powerful partner in each phase, enhancing your natural abilities while maintaining your creative control. Let's explore how CHOW can amplify each role:

### The Madman: Unleashing Creative Chaos

The Madman phase is all about uninhibited brainstorming and idea generation. Here's how AI can enhance your creative madness:

#### Prompt Storming

Use AI to generate multiple angles on your topic:

- "Show me 10 different ways to approach this topic"
- "What are some unconventional perspectives on this?"
- "Help me explore the extreme edges of this idea"

#### Idea Expansion

Let AI help you go deeper into each thought:

- Feed it your raw ideas and ask for related concepts
- Use it to find surprising connections between topics
- Ask it to play "what if" with your concepts

#### Research Assistant

While you're in creative flow, AI can:

- Find relevant quotes and references
- Suggest related topics to explore
- Gather supporting evidence for your ideas

Remember: In this phase, quantity beats quality. Let both your mind and the AI run wild.

### The Architect: Structuring Your Thoughts

The Architect phase is about organizing your chaos into coherent structure. AI can help by:

#### Pattern Recognition

Feed it your Madman output and ask:

- "What themes do you see in these ideas?"
- "How might we organize these thoughts?"
- "What's the most logical flow for these concepts?"

#### Outline Generation

Work with AI to:

- Create multiple possible outlines
- Test different organizational frameworks
- Identify gaps in your structure

**Examples**:

- Restructured my retirement guide's TOC using AI to improve flow and consistency - see the [conversation](https://github.com/idvorkin/idvorkin.github.io/blob/c58c85a628220e585f3211ca2d16baaa110b7851/chop-logs/enhancing-toc-consistency-for-retirement-guide.md) and [changes](https://github.com/idvorkin/idvorkin.github.io/commit/c58c85a628220e585f3211ca2d16baaa110b7851#diff-6cee02582eaf62a323c5d25f3fb08b32b208d286ca3b62efc2d41356700a1e14)
- Organized book references using consistent conventions - see the [changes](https://github.com/idvorkin/idvorkin.github.io/commit/e2322fb5e93943bf06c5cbefb6d56aa4462d69b8) and [conversation](https://gist.github.com/idvorkin/0f8ae3ab7c6fb762820c08ced4b2cefa)

#### Audience Analysis

Use AI to consider:

- How different readers might approach your content
- What background knowledge they'll need
- Where you might need more context or explanation

### The Carpenter: Crafting Your Words

In the Carpenter phase, you're building your first draft. AI can be your assistant by:

#### Draft Collaboration

Generate initial sections based on your outline:

- Generate initial sections based on your outline
- Suggest transitions between ideas
- Offer alternative phrasings

**Examples**:

- Added a security considerations section to CHOP documentation - see the [changes](https://github.com/idvorkin/idvorkin.github.io/commit/45241b48cde0b00af27f5e824f44c9c334d0e048#diff-61c44102203643ae4e0a122c0cac217a54cc9ddaf421e06d5be6c417747ab1c9) and [conversation](https://github.com/idvorkin/idvorkin.github.io/blob/45241b48cde0b00af27f5e824f44c9c334d0e048/cursor-logs/updating-chop-post-avoiding-secret-uploads.md)

#### Style Consistency

Help maintain your voice throughout:

- Help maintain your voice throughout
- Check for tone consistency
- Suggest improvements while preserving your style

#### Enhancement Suggestions

Identify areas for improvement:

- Identify places for examples or analogies
- Suggest where to add data or quotes
- Recommend areas that need more detail

### The Judge: Polishing Your Work

The Judge phase is about critical review and refinement. AI can help by:

#### Technical Review

Ensure technical accuracy and polish:

- Check grammar and style
- Identify repetitive phrases
- Ensure consistent terminology

#### Content Analysis

Verify the quality and flow of content:

- Verify logical flow
- Check for gaps in argumentation
- Ensure all claims are supported

#### Reader Perspective

Consider the audience's viewpoint:

- Simulate different reader reactions
- Identify potential points of confusion
- Suggest clarifications where needed

### Key Principles for AI-Enhanced Writing

1. **Keep the Phases Separate**:
   - Don't let AI's capabilities tempt you to mix phases
   - Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - Use different prompts for different phases

2. **Maintain Creative Control**:
   - AI is your assistant, not your replacement
   - Use AI to enhance your ideas, not generate them entirely
   - Trust your instincts when AI suggestions don't feel right

3. **Iterate with Purpose**:
   - Use AI feedback to improve each phase
   - Don't get stuck in endless refinement
   - Know when to move forward

## The Art of the Back-and-Forth

The magic of CHOW isn't in what AI produces - it's in how you collaborate. Understanding this changes everything.

### Filtering Is Easier Than Creating

Here's the core insight: **your taste is the bottleneck, not your idea generation.**

Creating from scratch is hard. Staring at a blank page, pulling ideas from nothing - that's cognitively expensive. But looking at five options and saying "that one, but tweak it this way"? That's easy. Your brain is wired for pattern recognition and preference, not ex nihilo creation.

This flips the traditional writing process. Instead of:
1. Think hard → produce draft → revise

You get:
1. Describe what you want → AI proposes options → you filter and refine

The AI handles the generative load. You handle the taste. Both play to their strengths.

### The Collaboration Patterns

**AI proposes, you filter.** Ask for five alternatives, not one answer. "Give me 5 title options" beats "What should the title be?" Options give you material to react to.

**Fast loops over perfect proposals.** Short exchanges, quick iteration. Say "3" or "mix 2 and 5" and move on. Momentum matters more than getting each step perfect.

**Think out loud, let AI structure.** Verbalize half-formed ideas. "I want something about... maybe the feeling of... or like when you..." The AI catches these fragments and helps crystallize them.

**Refine, don't just accept.** AI suggestions are starting points. Take "For Real" and make it "For This Human." The magic happens in your refinement.

**Systematic sweeps.** Go through your piece methodically - every heading, every section. Focused decisions beat scattered attention.

### AI Slop vs. Human Sludge

Everyone complains about AI slop - that generic, over-enthusiastic, emoji-laden output that screams "a robot wrote this."

But have you looked at LinkedIn lately? Twitter? Any social media? **Human sludge is everywhere.** Corporate jargon. Passive voice. "Learnings" and "deliverables" and "at the end of the day." Humble-brag posts. Engagement-bait threads. Throat-clearing paragraphs that say nothing. Humans produce absolute garbage without any AI help.

Here's the thing: **AI can be a hell of a lot better than human sludge.** At least AI doesn't have ego getting in the way. It doesn't pad content to sound important. It doesn't write to impress rather than communicate.

The bar isn't "as good as a human." The bar is "as good as the actual content humans produce" - and that bar is surprisingly low.

But of course, the real value isn't replacing human sludge with AI slop. It's using AI to **augment**: take human sludge and make it good, or take high-quality human content and make it even better. That's what CHOW is actually about.

## Deep ideas

### Beyond Images: Interactive Visualizations as Apps

When you first think about AI-generated content, images come to mind. But why stop there? CHOW can generate interactive visualizations - essentially small apps that let readers explore ideas dynamically rather than passively consuming static content.

Consider the difference:

- **Static image**: A diagram showing how religions evolved
- **Interactive app**: An [explorer](https://religion-evolution-explorer.surge.sh/) where readers can click through religious traditions, see connections, and discover relationships themselves

Or:

- **Static text**: "This post was written 3 years ago"
- **Interactive widget**: A [timeline visualization](https://idvorkin-how-long-since-ai.surge.sh/?show=tool) showing exactly how old content is, updating in real-time

These aren't just prettier presentations - they're fundamentally different experiences. Interactive content lets readers:

- Explore at their own pace and interest level
- Discover insights you didn't explicitly write
- Engage more deeply with the material
- Return and find new things each time

The tooling for this is increasingly accessible: React, Vite, and modern JavaScript frameworks make it straightforward to create these micro-apps. CHOW can help you design and build them conversationally, turning your content ideas into interactive experiences.

### Generating the content for the reader

The author now provides the raw content, and it can create content on demand optimized for the reader, which can include pivots like:

- Should it be interactive
- What age level to write for
- What interests does the read have.
- What format (text, tweet, video, audio)

Aerial talks about this nicely [here](https://gist.github.com/idvorkin/3cb3d50a175d3b2879ad537678704619#file-think-md)

For computer folks this is like [write path vs read path in data systems](/td/data-systems#write-path-vs-read-path)

### New monetization strategies

Instead of selling static assets (book, video) - you provide the content and it is generated for the reader.
