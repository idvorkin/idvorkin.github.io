Coding is way easier then people think. Here's some pointers.

First, use python, it's super easy. I highly recommend this online course which i would have called [programming for humans](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1)

With Zach we got to writing [Zong](/ig66/602)

Here are some other cool things to check out:

- Pykidos for [kids games](https://pykidos.github.io/)
- Hyperdiv for making [web UX via python](https://hyperdiv.io/)
