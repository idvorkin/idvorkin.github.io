Breathing, an act so simple yet so crucial, harbors the potential to transform our health, mind, and life. This blog post is a deep dive into the world of breathing techniques, exploring a range of practices from Box Breathing and Victory Breath to Sitali Breath and the Breath Focus Technique. Each technique is detailed with its benefits and step-by-step instructions. In addition, the scientific perspective on breathing is explored. Whether you're seeking to reduce stress, improve focus, or simply understand the science of breathing, this post is your comprehensive guide. Join us as we explore the art of breathing, its techniques, and the science behind it.

For a deeper understanding of the science behind breathing and its profound impact on our health, I highly recommend James Nestor's groundbreaking book:

I do a form of meditation with cyclic breathing called Sky Breathing. Pretty cool...
Hyperventilating

Good training available in the art of living breathing class

### The patterns

| Desired State              | Breathing Pattern                                            | How It Works                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Energized & Alert**      | Inhale 6, Exhale 4                                           | Longer inhales ramp up oxygen and sympathetic activity for alertness and energy.   |
| **Quick Energy Boost**     | Rapid Breathing: 30 sec fast inhales/exhales, hold exhale 15 | Hyperventilation spikes adrenaline and oxygen for an instant jolt.                 |
| **Euphoria/Intense Focus** | Wim Hof-ish: 30 rapid breaths, hold exhale 30                | Fast breathing floods oxygen, long hold shifts CO2 for a buzz and clarity.         |
| **Calm & Relaxed**         | Inhale 4, Exhale 8                                           | Extended exhales trigger parasympathetic response, lowering stress and heart rate. |
| **Focused & Steady**       | Box Breathing: Inhale 4, Hold 4, Exhale 4, Hold 4            | Balances oxygen/CO2, steadies the mind, and sharpens concentration.                |
| **Reset Breathing Rhythm** | Inhale 4, Exhale 6, Hold 6                                   | Post-exhale hold builds CO2 tolerance, calming erratic breathing.                  |
| **Improved Lung Capacity** | Inhale 6, Hold 10, Exhale 6                                  | Post-inhale hold stretches lungs and boosts oxygen uptake over time.               |

### Patterns and Chemistry

#### Inhale More vs. Exhale More

Breathing with a **longer inhale** (e.g., Inhale 6, Exhale 4) versus a **longer exhale** (e.g., Inhale 4, Exhale 8) shifts oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nervous system responses differently. Here’s the comparison:

| **Aspect**                | **Inhale More Than Exhale (e.g., Inhale 6, Exhale 4)** | **Exhale More Than Inhale (e.g., Inhale 4, Exhale 8)** |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Lung State**            | More time full—frequent deep inhales                   | More time emptying—extended exhales                    |
| **O2 Impact**             | Up—greater O2 intake from longer inhales               | Steady or slightly down—less O2 from shorter inhales   |
| **CO2 Impact**            | Down—more CO2 exhaled, less retained                   | Up—less CO2 exhaled, more retained                     |
| **Nervous System**        | Sympathetic dominant—activates fight-or-flight         | Parasympathetic dominant—triggers rest-and-digest      |
| **Feel**                  | Energized, alert, “revved up”                          | Calm, relaxed, “wound down”                            |
| **Short Hold (5-10 sec)** | Not typical here, but would amplify O2 boost           | Not typical here, but would deepen CO2 calm            |
| **Long Hold (20+ sec)**   | Not common, but could shift to tension                 | Not common, but could build CO2 tolerance              |
| **Best For**              | Energy, alertness, waking up                           | Relaxation, stress relief, sleep prep                  |

**Key Takeaways**

- **Inhale More**: Pumps O2, lowers CO2—energizes and sharpens focus.
- **Exhale More**: Retains CO2, eases O2 intake—calms and soothes.

#### Hold before or after

A **hold after inhale** (lungs full) and a **hold after exhale** (lungs empty) affect oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and your nervous system differently. Here’s how they compare:

| **Aspect**                | **Hold After Inhale (Full)**       | **Hold After Exhale (Empty)**           |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Lung State**            | Full—expanded, stretched           | Empty—relaxed, minimal air              |
| **O2 Impact**             | Up slightly—more absorption        | Down slightly—tissues use existing O2   |
| **CO2 Impact**            | Rises slowly—mild buildup          | Rises faster—triggers air hunger sooner |
| **Nervous System**        | Sympathetic + mild parasympathetic | Parasympathetic dominant                |
| **Feel**                  | Energized, focused, “loaded”       | Calm, grounded, “unloaded”              |
| **Short Hold (5-10 sec)** | Alertness, lung stretch            | Relaxation, CO2 reset                   |
| **Long Hold (20+ sec)**   | Tension or meditative shift        | Mild stress, CO2 tolerance              |
| **Best For**              | Energy, focus, lung capacity       | Calm, reset, tolerance                  |

**Key Takeaways**

- **Full Hold**: Boosts O2, stretches lungs, energizes with a focused vibe.
- **Empty Hold**: Raises CO2, calms the system, resets breathing.

### Techniques

#### Box Breathing

- Yoga name: Sama Vritti
- Why it helps: This technique can reduce stress and improve mood. It can also increase awareness and improve decision-making skills.
- How to do it: Breathe in for a count of four, hold your breath for a count of four, exhale for a count of four, and hold the breath out for a count of four.
- How to do it details: Maintain a straight posture and close your eyes if it feels comfortable. Keep your breath smooth and even throughout the cycle.

#### Bellows Breath/Hyper Ventilating

- Yoga name: Bhastrika Pranayama
- Why it helps: This technique can clear the nose and lungs, energize the body, and improve focus.
- How to do it: Take a deep breath in and then exhale quickly and forcefully through your nose, like a bellows.
- How to do it details: The inhalation and exhalation should be of equal duration, and you should feel the abdominal muscles moving in and out as you breathe.

#### Alternate Nostril Breathing

- Yoga name: Nadi Shodhana Pranayama
- Why it helps: This technique can calm the mind, reduce stress, and balance left and right hemispheres of the brain.
- How to do it: Close off one nostril, inhale through the other, switch nostrils and exhale through the just opened nostril.
- How to do it details: Continue this pattern, inhaling through the nostril you just exhaled out of.

#### Psychological Sigh

- Yoga name: Not associated with a specific yoga name
- Why it helps: This technique quickly relieves stress and anxiety by triggering the parasympathetic nervous system. It's particularly effective for moments of acute stress or when you need to calm down quickly.
- How to do it: Take two quick inhales through your nose (double inhale), followed by one long exhale through your mouth.
- How to do it details: The first inhale partially fills your lungs, the second inhale tops them off, and the extended exhale releases carbon dioxide and triggers relaxation. Repeat 2-3 times when feeling stressed or anxious.

#### Resonant or Coherent Breathing

- Yoga name: Not associated with a specific yoga name
- Why it helps: This technique can increase heart rate variability, reduce stress, and promote calm and well-being.
- How to do it: Inhale for a count of five, then exhale for a count of five.
- How to do it details: This technique is best done in a seated position, with the back straight.
