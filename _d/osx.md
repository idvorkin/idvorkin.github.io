I pretty much use mac exclusively. I have 3 at work, and a mac mini at home, and I'm an automation nerd so I try to have everything auto install/syncronize across the machines. On the mac, I'm either in chrome/edge, Cursor (the new VS.code), the terminal (I use iterm), capcut (video editor), zoom, or the few super handy utilities I list below.

## Philisophy

### Do not switch back and forth between windows and osx.

I used to try to use windows and mac, and move between them. Super hard on my brain. I highly recommend against. Give up windows, and go all mac. And you'll feel a lot better for it.

### When you go all in on the appleverse, it's glorious

iPhone/watch/iMessage/iPad, it all just works, syncs perfectly. it's a dream come true.
