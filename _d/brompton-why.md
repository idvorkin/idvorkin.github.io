### How it brings my pleasure

- Being able to take it on buses, subways, ubers, car2gos and people's trunks.
- Being able to throw it in people's trunks
- Riding it all the time
- Looking goofy
- All the people that ask me questions about it
- Telling people to try riding it

### The only improvements I can think of for the Brompton:

1. More gears - the gear range is good enough, but having more than 6 gears would be so much more helpful.
2. A water bottle holder. For a bike that is perfect in every way, it's surprising there is no water bottle holder.
