Creativity is a criticial aspect of art, and that's something which I think AI can be really good at. Some very random ideas

## Philosophy

### Sandwich Model of Creativity

_This can probably go into a broader ML category_

What’s common to all of these visions is something we call the “sandwich” workflow. This is a three-step process. First, a human has a creative impulse, and gives the AI a prompt. The AI then generates a menu of options. The human then chooses an option, edits it, and adds any touches they like.

From Stratechary:

_For most folks the sandwich workflow is very different from how people are used to working. There’s a natural worry that prompting and editing are inherently less creative and fun than generating ideas yourself, and that this will make jobs more rote and mechanical. Perhaps some of this is unavoidable, as when artisanal manufacturing gave way to mass production. The increased wealth that AI delivers to society should allow us to afford more leisure time for our creative hobbies…_

This mathces a a delegation model well from a senior to a junior, in fact this is exactly the model. The senior shares an intent and gaurdrails. The junior comes back with various options and a recommentation, the junior tweaks it, and then you've got an approach

### The value of art - inspiration

### Augmented Intelligence

We often need inspiration.

### Creativity

### Emotional Impact

### Surprise

## Tech

### Image Generators - Flux, stable diffusion

### TTS (Text to Speech) Read the content back with a different voice

We can have text to speech (TTS) with any voice, perhaps a famous voice saying something will inspire you:

OK, this one is much better - it can clone my voice

### NLP: GPT-3

### Face Generator

### Word to Image Generator: DALL-E and Stable Diffusion

- [Dall-E is OpenAI's Image Generator](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/) the examples lower in the blog post have some level of interaction.
- [Tool to do art with image generators](https://openart.ai/promptbook)

Run stable diffusion on M1 mac (WOW!!) - <https://github.com/brycedrennan/imaginAIry>

### Not a X

These use GAN to create not real things
