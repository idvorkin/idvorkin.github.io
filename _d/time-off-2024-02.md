It's midwinter break and I've got a week off. Most of these I try to do as a big family adventure. Finding something everyone wants to do is super challenging, so this time we tried something new, divide and conquer: I had a 1-2 day mini-vacations with Amelia, Zach, and even Tori. It worked out very well, the time-off was packed, Stanley Park with Amelia, Yellow Deli with Zach, and a crazy hotel on the Peninsula with Tori. On top of that restarting magic, balloons, and kettlebells and meditation in between.

Long ago, I learned I should pre-write these, but I decided (implicitly, by not applying discipline) to wing it, so I'm writing this at the end of the vacation.

This time off was probably easier than others as I got many environmental boosts to my inner peace:

- Work has been going great, and I only needed 1 hour to "disconnect from work". I'm actually excited to get back to work and dig into stuff, but I wrote it in a document and will pick it up when I'm back at work.
- Money Troubles have been great - stock market is through the roof, with Meta and MSFT at all-time highs!
- Health has been great, diet and exercise are dialed in.

My top priorities:

- Don't waste it by doing nothing.
- Recharge my "dealer of smiles and wonder" identity - doing balloons and magic.
- Create moments with the family (and take Selfies of them)
- Stay healthy (though this is easier than usual see below)

## Moments

- Zach to Yellow Deli
  - 6 hours with Zach talking about lots of blog content
- 2 times - Zach to improv, then subway to somewhere hopping and walk home together!
- Tori and I went on a mini-vacation (WOW!)
- Amelia and I did a 2-day trip to Vancouver (Stanley park, Denman street, and Granville Island)

## Success Stories

- Did magic several times:
- Did balloons (FIRST TIME IN MONTHS):
  - Kid at restaurant, kept thinking I should go to the car and get balloon stuff, finally did it after dinner. Of course, the kid loved it.
  - NOTE: Great work past Igor for leaving all the balloon accessories I need in the car!
- Lots of physical exercise:
  - Every time in Seattle hit the gym, and got great workouts
- Discovered [Bryan Johnson](/blueprint) and his blueprint idea. I'm definitely with him in spirit, though not his exact path.

## Top Learnings

_This is less new learnings, and more recounts to existing knowledge_

- It really is easier to divide and conquer the family
- Going to Vancouver when [Toni](/tesla) is driving is trivial
- The messed-up spoon story with Amelia :(
- Tori and Amelia prefer a plan in advance (this isn't much of a learning)
- I've gotten way better at travel thanks to all my MPK trips (I used to fret about packing for days, now I just have everything in my travel bag, and the car is packed with stuff)
- Have all the stuff I want pre-loaded (like balloon gear)
- My discipline:
  - I don't think of myself as being disciplined, but then people tell me you're crazy, you're super disciplined
    - I wake up at 4:30 and gym
    - I gym like 6 days a week for 1-2 hours
    - I meditate
    - I write a ton
    - I went years losing 5 lbs a month
  - I think what it is is I'm hyper-disciplined, but ...
    - I'm not realistic on how much I can do, so 20 habits I want, can only do 5, so some are always rotating in and out, not congruent with my deliberate desires
    - I get mental blocks, like can't cash checks on the fridge For years
    - Can't refill hot tub so haven't used it (which I love) for a year.

## Relationships

### Friends

- Most parents and kids folks were out of town for winter break
- Hang out w/Clive
- Week before Zach's parents' friends invited me out, wasn't sure I wanted to go, but did anyway so that I'd be able to join.

### Tori

Private, but we made time to go on a mini-vacation (WOW)! I'll keep it mostly secret, except

### Zach

- See the [Yellow Deli](/yellow-deli)
- Did spontaneous musical improv, then took light rail far away and walked home at night, pretty cool.
- Did spontaneous improv, then took light rail far away and walked home at night, pretty cool.

### Amelia

- Went to Vancouver (left at 6 am so she could sleep and we could get there by 9 am)
- Went go Granville Island, and Denman street, and stayed at Sylvia Hotel
- No pool at the hotel, so hit the Vancouver athletic club
- Messed up the spoon

## Identity Health

### Magic

- ☐ Practice Daily
- Magic for a kid hanging out at the magic store
- Server at the Yellow Deli (the thing he wished for was "Grace")
- Did magic for folks that had their deck standing in front of the Yellow Deli
- Zach nudged me to do magic!

### Biking

- ☐ Re-inflate my folding bike tires
- ☐ Put my big bike back out front
- ☐ Get lock for Brompton

### Tech Guru

- Found a cool framework for doing web UX in python, used it to do a [math game](https://github.com/idvorkin/mathflash) for Math Agency

#### Shell + Enabling Environment + Python in VIM

- Did some work on my AI bots
- Got some new insights into RAG (how hard it is)
- Start using my dual keyboard setup

## Cognitive Health

- Wrote up a bunch of blog posts
- Discovered [Bryan Johnson](/blueprint) and his blueprint idea. I'm definitely with him in spirit, though not his exact path.

### Meditation

- Worked on my informal box breathing
- Several days
- Doing it while charging in the Tesla

### 750 words/Gratefulness

- Remembered the sublime states, which are a larger category here, and seems more impactful for me.

## Physical Health

### Statistics

Weight Start: 189
Weight End: 187
Gym Days: 3

### Diet

- I'm doing terzepatide, so this is no longer a concern

### Sleep

- Didn't get enough, but worked well.

### Energy

- High

## House and goods

- Stocks are way up so feeling very financially secure (though security should come from production capacity, not the current assets)
- Basically own everything I want

## Mental quicksand

### Got grumpy about some stuff

Dug back into sublime states, that's super helpful

{% include summarize-page.html src="/sublime" %}

### Angry that wasting my vacation, and sacred time with family

The antidote is doing stuff, divide and conquer to reduce the activation energy and tackle it
