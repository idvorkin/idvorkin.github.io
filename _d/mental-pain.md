Pain is in the brain as they say, which is especially true for mental pains. Pain isn't the enemy though, pain is a signal. The pain system, when working properly brings our perspective to a problem so that we can deal with it. However, pain can also be phantom pain, meaning it is being applied when it should not be, or chronic pain, which flares up even though it is no longer providing value.

## The point of pain

## Pain vs Suffering

Humans need things to have meaning. To give our pain meaning, we usually add suffering. Suffering is the made-up story that transforms our pain from "I have a problem I need to address" to "he doesn't like me", "I'm screwed", "I'll never be able to show my face again."

Pain is a good thing, suffering is the problem.

## Phantom vs Real Pain

Just like a car's warning system can malfunction, our mental pain systems can be **under-active, over-active, or well-calibrated**.

**Well-calibrated pain** serves its purpose perfectly:

- **Anxiety before a job interview** → signals you to prepare
- **Guilt after hurting someone** → signals you to make amends
- **Disappointment after a failure** → signals you to reassess your approach

**Under-active pain** is dangerous - like a broken smoke detector:

- **No guilt when harming others** (sociopathy)
- **No anxiety about real threats** (poor judgment)
- **No disappointment when failing** (no learning)

**Over-active pain** is exhausting - like a car alarm that won't stop:

- **Phantom anxiety** when there's no actual threat (panic attacks)
- **Phantom guilt** when you've done nothing wrong
- **Phantom disappointment** that spirals into depression

**The key question**: Is this pain pointing to something that actually needs my attention right now, or is it just noise from a faulty alarm system?

**Real pain** has a clear message and suggests concrete action. **Phantom pain** is vague, repetitive, and offers no constructive path forward.

## Types of pain

Mental pain falls into three categories, each requiring different approaches:

### Psychological Pain (Self-focused)

These are pains you can experience even if you were alone in the universe:

**Self-doubt** - "Am I capable of handling this?"
**Self-disappointment** - "I failed to meet my own standards"  
**Loss of control** - "I can't manage what's happening to me" (the root of most anxiety)

### Interpersonal Pain (Relationship-focused)

These require another person, even if only in memory or imagination:

**Guilt/Unfairness** - Contract violations (you broke a promise vs. someone broke a promise to you)
**Shame/Disappointment** - Exposure of inadequacy (you were revealed as incapable vs. someone else was)
**Loss of autonomy/Abandonment** - Distance problems (too close/controlled vs. too far/disconnected)

### Spiritual Pain (Life-journey focused)

These are about the meaning and direction of your existence:

**Hopelessness** - "Nothing will ever improve"
**Meaninglessness** - "My life has no purpose or direction"
**Regret** - "I've wasted precious time and opportunities"

**Why categorization matters**: The same surface emotion (like "I feel bad") could stem from any of these levels. A skilled approach requires identifying which type of pain you're actually experiencing, because the solutions are completely different.

## Where's the pain

### Self

#### Control: Anxiety

{%include summarize-page.html src="/anxiety" %}

#### Doubt: Self Doubt

#### Disappointment: Self disappointment

### Other - From you, to you

#### Control: Controlling, loss of autonomy

#### Doubt: Abandonment, Taking for granted

#### Disappointment: Guilt/[shame](/shame)/Embarrassed, Unfair, 2

Remember, just because you can feel guilt/shame/embarrassed, doesn't mean you should.

### Process - In your life

#### Control: [Anxiety](/anxiety)

{%include summarize-page.html src="/anxiety" %}

#### Doubt: Mistrust and Meaninglessness

#### Disappointment: Guilt/[shame](/shame)/Embarrassed, Unfair

## Pain and Suffering without progress

Pain is often a signal to drive progress (like need to study for interviews, getting done performance reviews, etc). Once you've completed the progress, pain (and likely suffering) can go away.

However, through the power of procrastination/resistance you can have the worst of all worlds: the pain and suffering without progress.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/frog" %}

The more lack of progress, the more pain and suffering, and then guilt and self-disappointment. Getting things done helps resolve this:

{%include summarize-page.html src="/gtd" %}

But some crib notes:

**Allocate concrete time and goals** Best efforts to get stuff done won't happen.

**Give yourself large blocks of time** Don't expect to grind through something painful in 30 minutes. This wouldn't be painful if it was easy to do, you'll often need time to get in the groove before you can make progress. Give yourself large blocks of time - like 2 hours at a time.

**Don't take a step forward and a step backward** A great example of this is dieting. I'll often diet for half a day and then gorge the other half. As a result, a half day of pain with no gain. Either diet that day or don't. Similarly, if you're studying write down your notes. If you just "think about it", but don't do a partial completion - complete waste.

## Fueling the fire, adding meaning

### Meaning: From Pain to Suffering

Humans need to apply meaning, in the case of pain, suffering is the meaning we apply. We should examine the meaning carefully, it drastically changes our experience.

Suffering of labor - 1 woman, 5 months in , 1 woman 9 months in.
Suffering of hitting thumb with hammer: Carpenter, Convert Violinist, concert next day.

### Meaning squared: From Suffering to Misery

Meaning is mandatory, but we can mess up and apply meaning to our suffering. This is completely unnecessary.

**Victim: Nothing I can do**

You can always have an impact - there is always hope. Even if the impact is just how you experience it. For example, you are influencing it, making it worse by investing in this victim mentality.

Note, this is in fact the definition of depression. Learned helplessness.

**Screwed over: It wasn't fair**

Fairness is an illusion. Life provided you no such guarantee, so this is always a false thought.

## The positive analogs of pain: Pleasure, Satisfaction, Hubris

Pain to pleasure - Pleasure, often of consumption, a sweet treat. But meaningless.
Satisfaction - More meaningful than pleasure, often from accomplishment or connection.

### Misery to Hubris

## Loneliness

- Boredom is the loss of connection
- [Loneliness is bad for your health](https://www.cdc.gov/aging/publications/features/lonely-older-adults.html)

## Physical Pain, Injury, Recovery

Perhaps back pain as an analog.

Just like your back carries a physical load, so too does your "psyche" carry an emotional load. And like your back, at any given time you have a maximum load.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/physical-pain"%}

Your strength/Load Bearing Ability:

Also like your back, there can be static structures that are mostly genetically rated - like the discs, there are also trainable structures, like your core muscles (or your analytic abilities) which you can train.

Initial injury:

- You exceed load-bearing ability of some structure (disc)
- Pain makes you focus, and stop injuring that disc.
- You stop, pain stops.

Wrong answer: But if all you do is stop, and rest for a while

- Pain goes away you're good?
- Now the structure is weaker, so it will get injured again and even easier.
- This is a false start.

Right answer: Train smart: Gradual increase in load

- You need to slowly get stronger with a "lighter version" of the thing you have trouble with.
- You will feel residual pain, but it's often just a "phantom/residual" pain. The more you do, the more it goes away.

Right answer: Stop doing high-risk activities

- At the same time, some activities you want to stop. For example, I stopped dead lifting, because the "precision required" to avoid injury isn't worth the benefit.

Final load-bearing ability:

- Usually the dynamic structures are stronger.

## Misc topics

### Pride vs Self Confidence vs Hubris/Arrogance

Interesting - in Dr. Raph's model, pride is good, arrogance is bad. The test for the boundary is "how impressive is the achievement?" [Pride ducking with you](/pride) is my post on pride and arrogance.
