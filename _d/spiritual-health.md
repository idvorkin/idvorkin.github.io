Spiritual health is one of the most confusing dimensions of well-being because different frameworks define it completely differently. After reading multiple books on happiness and energy management, I've realized they're actually addressing two distinct problems that both fall under "spiritual health": knowing your purpose (direction) and experiencing transcendence (perspective).

## What Do We Mean by "Meaning"?

Before diving into frameworks, we need to address a fundamental confusion: different experts use "meaning" to describe completely different aspects of spiritual health. This isn't just semantic nitpicking - these definitional differences explain why frameworks seem to conflict and why you might have one type of meaning while desperately lacking another.

### Three Dimensions of Meaning

Researchers have identified three distinct components that all get called "meaning" in different contexts:

**1. Meaning as Coherence (Comprehension)**

This is meaning as "making sense" - your life has a narrative structure that you can understand:

- Events aren't random; there's a pattern or logic
- Your story hangs together coherently
- You can explain how you got where you are
- Example: "I understand why this happened to me"

Without coherence, life feels chaotic and arbitrary. You might have clear goals and matter to others, but nothing makes sense.

**2. Meaning as Significance (Mattering)**

This is meaning as "having worth" - your existence makes a difference:

- Your life has value and importance
- What you do impacts others
- You matter in the larger scheme of things
- Example: "My work/relationships/contributions matter"

Without significance, life feels pointless. You might understand your story and know where you're going, but wonder "so what?"

**3. Meaning as Purpose (Direction)**

This is meaning as "having aims" - you know where you're headed:

- Clear sense of goals and intentions
- Values that guide your decisions
- A mission or calling to pursue
- Example: "I know what I'm trying to accomplish"

Without purpose, life feels aimless. You might matter and make sense, but have no idea what to do next.

### How Different Frameworks Define Meaning

Here's where the confusion becomes clear - each framework emphasizes different dimensions:

**Viktor Frankl (Logotherapy):**

- Primary emphasis: **Significance through self-transcendence**
- "Meaning" = Your life matters because you contribute to something beyond yourself
- Even suffering has meaning when you choose your attitude toward it
- Less concerned with coherence or specific purposes

**Arthur Brooks (Build the Life You Want):**

- Primary emphasis: **Significance beyond self-interest**
- "Meaning" = One of three happiness components (with enjoyment and satisfaction)
- Specifically tied to serving others and causes greater than yourself
- Assumes purpose emerges from significance

**MLQ - Meaning in Life Questionnaire (Steger):**

- Measures: **All three dimensions combined**
- "Presence of meaning" = Having coherence + significance + purpose
- "Search for meaning" = Actively seeking any/all of these dimensions
- Most comprehensive definition but can obscure which dimension is missing

**Four Healths Framework (Igor):**

- Primary emphasis: **Purpose as direction**
- "Meaning" = Knowing your mountain, having clear values and goals
- Treats transcendence/significance as potentially separate
- Focuses on the navigational aspect of meaning

**Power of Full Engagement (Loehr & Schwartz):**

- Primary emphasis: **Purpose that energizes action**
- "Meaning" = Connection to values that fuel engagement
- Bridges purpose and significance ("purpose beyond self-interest")
- Views meaning as the energy source for all life dimensions

**The critical insight:** When someone says they "lack meaning," they might be missing any combination of:

- Understanding (coherence)
- Mattering (significance)
- Direction (purpose)

And when different books promise to help you "find meaning," they might be addressing completely different problems. This explains why advice that transforms one person's life leaves another cold - they're solving different equations.

## Common Spiritual Problems

The two primary spiritual health problems are lack of purpose (not knowing your mountain) and lack of transcendence (taking yourself too seriously). But there are several other failure modes in spiritual health:

### Problem 1: "You Don't Know Your Mountain" (Purpose)

**What breaks:**

- You feel directionless even when succeeding by external measures
- You go through motions without knowing why
- You can't make value-aligned decisions because you don't know your values
- The work gets done but feels hollow

**The cure: Purpose Anchoring**

- Clear sense of personal purpose and values
- Regular engagement with your [eulogy](/eulogy) - who you want to be
- Making decisions aligned with your values
- Knowing which mountain you're climbing and why

**Example failure case:** The professionally successful person who has achieved everything they thought they wanted but feels empty and wonders "what's the point of all this?"

### Problem 2: "You're Too Big" (Transcendence)

**What breaks:**

- Life feels like a tedious sitcom where you're the main character
- Your problems loom disproportionately large
- You lack perspective on what actually matters
- Anxiety and depression from taking yourself too seriously

**The cure: Self-Transcendence**

- Walking in nature at dawn without devices, watching sunrise
- Meditation and prayer
- Philosophy and deep intellectual engagement with ideas bigger than yourself
- Service to causes larger than yourself
- Seeking truth and serving others (NOT pursuing personal happiness)

**Example failure case:** The person who knows exactly what they want and why, but burns out from treating every setback as catastrophic because they lack cosmic perspective.

### Problem 3: Spiritual Bypass (Using Spirituality to Avoid Reality)

**What breaks:**

- Using spiritual practices to avoid uncomfortable emotions or unresolved issues
- "Rising above" problems without actually facing them
- Detachment that's really just emotional avoidance
- Excessive positivity that denies legitimate pain or problems

**The mechanism:** Coined by psychotherapist John Welwood, spiritual bypassing is "trying to rise above the raw and messy side of our humanness before we have fully faced and made peace with it." The ego uses spirituality as another defense mechanism.

**Examples:**

- Using meditation to suppress emotions rather than process them
- "Everything happens for a reason" to avoid grieving or taking responsibility
- Premature forgiveness that bypasses necessary anger
- Spiritual platitudes instead of acknowledging real problems

**What's missing:** Emotional health - the capacity to actually feel and process difficult emotions. Spiritual transcendence without emotional integration creates a false spirituality built on avoidance.

**The cure:** Do the emotional work first. Feel your feelings, process your trauma, acknowledge your pain. THEN transcend. Real transcendence includes your humanity, doesn't bypass it.

### Problem 4: Spiritual Materialism (Ego Hijacking Spirituality)

**What breaks:**

- Using spiritual practices to boost ego rather than transcend it
- Accumulating spiritual credentials or experiences as status symbols
- Believing your spiritual development makes you special or superior
- Turning spirituality into another form of achievement or competition

**The mechanism:** Tibetan Buddhist teacher Chögyam Trungpa warned: "The problem is that ego can convert anything to its own use, even spirituality." What starts as genuine spiritual seeking becomes about ego enhancement.

**Trungpa's Three Forms:**

1. **Physical materialism** - Believing possessions/status bring spiritual release
2. **Psychological materialism** - Believing a particular belief system brings release (rigid identification with a religion or philosophy)
3. **Spiritual materialism** - Believing a particular state of mind brings release (using meditation to create pleasant states, chasing spiritual highs)

**Spiritual narcissism:** The extreme form where someone believes their spiritual wisdom makes them better than others. The ego becomes "so solid, so fixed, so unyielding in the idea of its own spiritual greatness that it is pathological."

**What's missing:** True humility and self-transcendence. The spiritual practice has been co-opted by ego as another way to feel superior, special, or separate.

**The cure:** Recognize when spiritual practice is feeding ego rather than dissolving it. True spiritual progress makes you more humble, not more special. If your spirituality is making you feel superior to others, that's ego, not transcendence.

### Problem 5: Spiritual Crisis (Meaning System Collapse)

**What breaks:**

- Drastic changes to your meaning system (loss of faith, worldview shattering)
- Existential crisis where previous sources of meaning no longer work
- Identity crisis triggered by spiritual awakening or loss
- Significant disruption in psychological, social, and occupational functioning

**The mechanism:** When your entire framework for making meaning collapses - whether through loss, trauma, mystical experience, or philosophical crisis - you lose the capacity to find meaning, peace, comfort, or connection in life.

**What's different from lack of purpose:** This isn't about never having found purpose - it's about having your purpose/meaning system COLLAPSE. The foundation you built your life on has cracked.

**Examples:**

- Loss of religious faith that defined your identity
- Near-death experience that shatters your worldview
- Trauma that makes previous meaning-making impossible
- "Dark night of the soul" experiences in spiritual practice

**What's needed:** Rebuilding a meaning system from the ground up. Often requires both psychological support (therapy) and spiritual guidance. Can't be rushed - the collapse must be honored before reconstruction.

**The opportunity:** Crisis can be transformation. Sometimes the old meaning system needed to collapse for a more authentic one to emerge. As Frankl showed, even in crisis, meaning can be found through attitude and values.

### Problem 6: Spiritual Distress (Unable to Access Meaning)

**What breaks:**

- No longer able to find meaning, peace, comfort, strength, or connection in life
- Rupture of spiritual/religious belief systems
- Existential suffering when facing death, loss, or terminal illness
- Feeling spiritually abandoned or disconnected

**The mechanism:** Similar to spiritual crisis but often triggered by specific circumstances (illness, loss, trauma) rather than developmental collapse. The spiritual capacity to access meaning is blocked or damaged.

**What's different from lack of purpose:** You may know what should matter, but can't FEEL the connection to it anymore. The spiritual channel is blocked.

**Common in:** Palliative care, severe depression, PTSD, prolonged suffering. Recognized in DSM-5 as "Religious or Spiritual Problems."

**What's needed:** Often requires addressing both the underlying circumstance (grief, illness, trauma) AND rebuilding spiritual connection. Can't address spiritually without also addressing emotionally/physically.

## Four Frameworks on Spiritual Health

### Viktor Frankl: Meaning Through Self-Transcendence

Viktor Frankl's "Man's Search for Meaning" may be the foundational text on spiritual health. Written by a Holocaust survivor and psychiatrist, it introduces **logotherapy** - therapy through meaning. Frankl's core insight predates and arguably underlies all modern frameworks on purpose and transcendence.

As noted in our [definitions above](#three-dimensions-of-meaning), Frankl primarily emphasizes **significance through self-transcendence** - your life matters because you contribute to something beyond yourself.

{%include amazon.html asin="0807014273" %}

**The Primary Human Drive:** At the heart of logotherapy is a radical claim: "The primary motivational force of individuals is to find meaning in life." Not pleasure (Freud), not power (Adler), but **meaning**. This is the fundamental human drive.

**Self-Transcendence as Core Mechanism:** Frankl emphasizes that meaning is found through **self-transcendence** - "connecting with something greater than oneself, and finding significance in relationships and societal contributions." His definition: "We can find our true self only by letting go of the old one."

**Three Paths to Meaning:**

Frankl identified three ways to discover meaning in life:

1. **Creating a work or doing a deed** - Purpose through contribution and achievement
2. **Experiencing something or encountering someone** - Meaning through love, beauty, truth
3. **The attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering** - Finding meaning even in what cannot be changed

This third path is Frankl's most profound contribution: meaning can be found even in suffering when we choose our attitude toward it. "Being human involves exposure to the tragic triad of life, comprised of unavoidable guilt, suffering, and death, and in these circumstances, meaning can still be derived from the attitude we take toward the situation."

**Spiritual Dimension:** Logotherapy was revolutionary for introducing "a focus on the spiritual dimension of the human psyche, previously ignored by most psychotherapists." For Frankl, spiritual health isn't religious - it's the dimension where we confront questions of meaning, value, and purpose.

**Diagnosis:** "Frankl believed depression occurred at the psychological, physiological, and spiritual levels, with the depressed individual facing tension at the spiritual level between who they actually are in relation to what they should be." This tension between actual and ideal self happens in the spiritual dimension.

**Key Techniques:**

- **Paradoxical Intention:** Overcome fear by anticipating and even wishing for what you fear, removing fear from your intention
- **Dereflection:** Stop obsessing on yourself; redirect attention outward toward meaning (accessing self-transcendence)
- **Socratic Dialogue:** Discover your own meaning through questioning rather than being told what it should be

**Frankl's Unique Integration:** What makes Frankl essential is that he explicitly combines BOTH purpose and transcendence:

- **Purpose:** You must find YOUR specific meaning (can't be prescribed; discovered through Socratic dialogue)
- **Transcendence:** That meaning is found by connecting to something beyond yourself (relationships, work, society, values larger than self-interest)

His model shows these aren't separate - purpose IS transcendence. You find your purpose BY transcending self-focus. The path to meaning runs through self-transcendence.

**The Paradox:** "Frankl took a surprisingly hopeful view of people's capacity to transcend their predicament and discover an adequate guiding truth." Even in concentration camps, those who found meaning in their suffering - through their attitude, through serving others, through holding onto values - survived better than those focused on their own survival.

The lesson: Spiritual health isn't about finding the right circumstances. It's about finding meaning regardless of circumstances. And that meaning is always found through self-transcendence - through connecting to something beyond your immediate self-interest.

### Arthur Brooks: Transcendence Through Getting Small

In [Build The Life You Want](/build-life-you-want), Brooks describes faith as "anything transcendent that helps you escape the boring sitcom that is your life." His core insight: **"You need to get small."**

Brooks' framework emphasizes **significance beyond self-interest** (see [definitions above](#three-dimensions-of-meaning)) - meaning emerges when you serve causes and people beyond yourself.

**The mechanism:** Standing in awe of something vastly larger makes you appropriately small, which paradoxically provides perspective and peace. "What we need is a sense of the transcendent that makes us small, because we need perspective."

**Specific practices:**

- Walking in nature at dawn without devices, experiencing awe from sunrise
- Meditation and prayer (Brooks combines rosary prayer with meditation techniques from Tibetan monks)
- Philosophy and deep intellectual engagement - "the transcendental walk in ideas and concepts every single day that are bigger than you"
- Service to causes larger than yourself

**Critical distinction:** The goal should be "seeking truth and the good of others" - NOT pursuing personal happiness. Happiness follows naturally as a byproduct.

Brooks addresses Chapter 8 "Find Your Amazing Grace" to three challenges:

1. **Your Monkey Mind** - Mind wandering that avoids emotions and prevents presence
2. **Getting Started** - Just start somewhere rather than waiting for perfect clarity
3. **The Right Focus** - Don't pursue spirituality for personal happiness; seek truth and serve others

Research shows spiritual practices protect against depression and anxiety by providing perspective that makes personal concerns appropriately small.

### My Four Healths: Purpose as Direction

In my [Four Healths framework](/four-healths), I treat spiritual health as your **purpose anchor** - the connection to meaning and purpose that prevents aimlessness.

This framework primarily emphasizes **purpose as direction** ([see definitions](#three-dimensions-of-meaning)) - knowing your mountain, having clear values and goals to navigate by.

**What it enables:**

- Persisting through difficulty when results are far away
- Making decisions aligned with your values
- Finding meaning in ordinary moments
- Staying engaged rather than just going through motions

**Core components:**

- Clear sense of purpose and values
- Connection to something larger than yourself
- Rituals that mark transitions and create meaning
- Regular reflection on what matters

**What breaks without it:**

- Feeling aimless despite achievement
- Disengagement and going through motions
- Burnout from lack of meaning
- Difficulty making value-aligned decisions

This framework emphasizes **knowing your mountain** - you need direction, not just perspective. Spiritual rituals anchor you to your deeper "why" and give ordinary moments significance.

### Power of Full Engagement: The Bridge Between Both

Loehr and Schwartz in "The Power of Full Engagement" define spiritual energy as "connection to deeply held values and a purpose beyond our self-interest." This definition brilliantly bridges both frameworks:

Their approach combines **purpose as direction** with **significance beyond self** ([see definitions](#three-dimensions-of-meaning)), viewing meaning as the energy that fuels all action.

- **Like my framework:** Emphasizes connection to YOUR deeply held values (purpose/direction)
- **Like Brooks:** Emphasizes "purpose beyond our self-interest" (transcendence/getting small)

**Their key insight:** "Purpose becomes more powerful when it moves from negative to positive, external to internal, and **self to others**." This progression suggests spiritual energy starts with personal purpose but matures into transcendent service.

**Unique contribution:** They frame spiritual energy as the **force for action** - it "fuels passion, perseverance, and commitment" and "provides the force for action in all dimensions of our lives." This makes it foundational rather than just another pillar.

**Character as spiritual capacity:** They define character as "the courage and conviction to live by our deepest values." This aligns with purpose anchoring - knowing your values isn't enough; spiritual health is the capacity to actually live by them under pressure.

The supporting "muscles" of spiritual energy:

- Character (courage and conviction to live by values)
- Passion
- Commitment
- Integrity
- Honesty

**Rituals:** They emphasize that "rituals create a means by which to translate our values and priorities into action." Spiritual health isn't just having values - it's building the automatic behaviors that keep you aligned with them.

## Are These Two Dimensions or One?

With our understanding of the [three dimensions of meaning](#three-dimensions-of-meaning), we can now see that the apparent conflict between frameworks comes from emphasizing different aspects of meaning.

### The Case for Two Separate Dimensions

These frameworks address **orthogonal failure modes** - you can have one without the other:

**You can have transcendence without purpose:**

- You feel appropriately small in the cosmic scheme
- You experience awe regularly and escape the tedium
- But you still don't know what YOU should be doing
- You're inspired but aimless about your own path
- Example: The spiritually minded person who meditates daily and feels connected to something greater but can't figure out their career or relationships

**You can have purpose without transcendence:**

- You know exactly what matters to you and why
- Your values are crystal clear, decisions aligned
- But you take yourself and your mission TOO seriously
- Your problems loom too large because you lack cosmic perspective
- Example: The driven founder who knows their mission but burns out from treating every setback as catastrophic

**Both missing:**

- Aimless AND self-absorbed
- Don't know where you're going AND take yourself too seriously
- No direction AND no perspective

This suggests they should be separate dimensions: **Purpose** (knowing your mountain) and **Transcendence** (getting appropriately small).

### The Case for Developmental Stages

Both "Power of Full Engagement" and Viktor Frankl suggest these might be developmental stages rather than separate dimensions:

**Stage 1: Purpose develops from self-focused to other-focused**

- Early: "What do I want?" (self-focused purpose)
- Mature: "How do I serve?" (other-focused purpose = transcendence)

**Stage 2: Purpose becomes more powerful through progression**
Loehr/Schwartz's insight that purpose strengthens as it moves "from self to others" suggests transcendence isn't separate - it's what purpose becomes when it matures.

**Stage 3: Frankl's Integration**
Frankl's model most explicitly shows this progression: You find YOUR meaning (purpose), but that meaning is ONLY found through self-transcendence (connecting to something beyond yourself). Purpose and transcendence aren't separate - purpose IS the result of self-transcendence.

His three paths to meaning demonstrate this:

- Creating work → transcending self through contribution
- Loving someone → transcending self through relationship
- Attitude toward suffering → transcending self through values

**Spiritual energy as foundation:** Loehr/Schwartz's framing of spiritual energy as "the force for action in all dimensions" suggests it's not another pillar alongside physical/emotional/cognitive - it's the underlying capacity that energizes all of them.

This view suggests: You start with personal purpose (know your mountain), and as spiritual capacity grows, that purpose naturally expands through self-transcendence (seeing your mountain as part of a vast range, climbing for something beyond yourself).

## Practical Implications

Regardless of whether these are separate dimensions or developmental stages, both are needed:

**If you lack purpose (don't know your mountain):**

- Work on clarity: [eulogy](/eulogy), values identification, reflection on what matters
- Build rituals that keep you connected to your "why"
- Make decisions aligned with values to build character
- Focus inward first - you need direction before you can transcend

**If you lack transcendence (taking yourself too seriously):**

- Cultivate awe: nature walks at dawn, meditation, philosophy
- Shift focus from "what will make ME happy" to "what is true and how can I serve"
- Get small - intentionally experience perspective on your place in the universe
- Focus outward - connect to something vastly larger than yourself

**If you lack both:**

- Start with purpose - it's hard to transcend when you don't know what you're transcending toward
- Once you have some direction, begin cultivating awe and perspective
- Build rituals that maintain both (weekly reflection on purpose + daily transcendent practices)

**If you have both:**

- You're in the rare position of knowing your mountain AND having perspective on the range
- Your challenge: maintaining both through life's inevitable changes
- Keep both practice streams active - purpose without transcendence becomes obsession, transcendence without purpose becomes escapism

The key insight from all three frameworks: Spiritual health requires intentional practice. Whether you call it rituals (Power of Full Engagement), spiritual practices (Brooks), or purpose anchoring (Four Healths), you need consistent actions that keep you connected to both your personal values and something beyond yourself.
