I'm incredibly fortunate to be able to take 6 weeks off this summer! From when performance reviews finish to when the kids go back to school, it'll be summer vacation.

It's a special year since Zach will be going into high school, and Amelia into Grade 5!

To get the most out of my time off, I'm going to follow my best practice of pre-writing what I want to get done, and adjust it as I go. This is a combination of [time off](/time-off), and all the stuff for [happiness](/happy), which I guess gets tangled up with half of my evergreen notes.

## Topic

### Divide and Conquer - By Person

Family time is great, but so is time together so I think I'll split the time up,

- A week with each kid, a week for myself, and a week for the family.
- All in one place, or travel the world.

### Bulk Discount - Stay at the same place the whole time

- I thought about it, but honestly, why, variety is the spice of life

### From 12 months to 6 weeks

Four years ago, I dreamed of taking a year off of work. A few things have changed, Meta doesn't do unpaid leaves, and the software industry has gone through some employment turbulence (e.g. layoffs), so I've replanned and am taking 6 weeks of vacation

## By Week

| Week Dates - People         | Activities                 | Notes                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |

| 2) July 28 - Family         | [l2](l2)                   |                          |
| 3) August 4 - Alone         | [l3](l3)                   | A at Farm; Z rowing      |
| 4) August 11 - Alone        | TBD                        | A at Film Camp; Z Rowing |
| 5) August 18 - Amelia       | TBD                        | Z Rowing                 |
| 6) August 25 - Family       | TBD                        |                          |
| DONE: Sept 4 - Back to Work | Back to Work/School Starts |                          |

### Video publishing

- Using Loom to Record Videos (FaceCam) and then edit via text (Super cool)

Using alfred and yabai:

{%include youtube.html src="_isNIAuHnEg" %}

OK, yabai is cool, I think aerospace will end up better, but I need to [support resizing splits](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace/issues/266), which yabaio does very nicely as I like to switch from halves to thirds.

Using think.py:

{%include youtube.html src="DuluVSnJGqg" %}

- Using the desktop within VR

{%include youtube.html src="asjUiUBjrZI" %}
