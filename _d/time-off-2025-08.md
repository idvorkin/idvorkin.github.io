I'm incredibly fortunate to be able to take 6 weeks off this summer! After 5 years of service at Meta, you get 30 days (about 5 week) off!

It's a special year since Zach will be going into grade 10, and Amelia into Middle school

To get the most out of my time off, I'm going to follow my best practice of pre-writing what I want to get done, and adjust it as I go. This is a combination of [time off](/time-off), and all the stuff for [happiness](/happy), which I guess gets tangled up with half of my evergreen notes.

## Topic

### Tori is organizing again

Tori and I spent a lot of time on our relationship this year, and she's organized the whole trip! It's gonna be great having a planner to make sure everything happens.

### From 12 months to 6 weeks

Five years ago, I dreamed of taking a year off of work - [a gap year](/gap-year-igor) if you will. I spent a lot of time thinking through a gap year, and it's more important then ever now that the kids are running out of time. But that's a separate blog post

{%include summarize-page.html src="/gap-year-igor"%}

### The Great Monday Cat Visitation Protocol (Or: How We Became Slaves to Our Feline Overlords)

Here's our travel hack: the Monday Cat Check-In System™. Instead of pet sitters, we return every Monday to prevent feline coups and unauthorized DoorDash orders.

Perfect timing since we booked Monday improv classes with [Matt Smith](https://www.mattsmithimprov.com/), who helped establish Seattle's comedy scene in the '90s. Our routine: check on judgmental cats ("Oh, you're back AGAIN?"), then learn to be funny on command.

The cats have caught on, scheduling Sunday night drama for maximum Monday impact. But instead of shoe logistics operations, we're more likely to find nature's surprises: a desiccated hummingbird artfully displayed on the welcome mat, or a beheaded rabbit positioned like modern art in the hallway. I'm pretty sure they're testing our commitment to this arrangement.

But honestly? Weekly guaranteed animal discovery AND comedy training while road-tripping? Pure genius.

- Final Leg home - Tony forgot how to drive

  - Igor had to drive instead.
  - BUT, Igor forgot how to drive!
  - Took the 405 as i5 was closed, but then forgot I need to follow directions and didn't take 520 exist,
  - Driving is a lost skill for me.
  - But on the bright side, I learned about the service menu, pretty cool to see all the backup systems and monitoring in there.
