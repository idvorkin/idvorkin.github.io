I'm incredibly fortunate to be able to take 6 weeks off this summer! After 5 years of service at Meta, you get 30 days (about 5 week) off!

It's a special year since Zach will be going into grade 10, and Amelia into Middle school

To get the most out of my time off, I'm going to follow my best practice of pre-writing what I want to get done, and adjust it as I go. This is a combination of [time off](/time-off), and all the stuff for [happiness](/happy), which I guess gets tangled up with half of my evergreen notes.

## Topic

### Tori is organizing again

Tori and I spent a lot of time on our relationship this year, and she's organized the whole trip! It's gonna be great having a planner to make sure everything happens.

### From 12 months to 6 weeks

Five years ago, I dreamed of taking a year off of work - [a gap year](/gap-year-igor) if you will. I spent a lot of time thinking through a gap year, and it's more important then ever now that the kids are running out of time. But that's a separate blog post
