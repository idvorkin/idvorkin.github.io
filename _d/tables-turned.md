When did my kids stop being students and start being teachers? I'm not sure exactly when it happened, but somewhere along the way, the tables turned. Now my kids are my role models.

## The Arc: Caretaker → Collaborator → Student

The parent-child relationship isn't static. It evolves through distinct phases, and if you're paying attention, you realize you've been promoted - or maybe demoted - to student.

### Phase 1: Caretaker - "Let me show you"

This is where it starts. You know things. They don't. You tie their shoes, teach them to read, explain why the sky is blue. The information flows one direction: down.

<!-- TODO: Add specific early memories -->

### Phase 2: Collaborator - "Let's figure this out together"

Somewhere in the middle, things shift. You're no longer the sole source of knowledge. You start having actual conversations. They have opinions - good ones. You solve problems together.

<!-- TODO: Add examples of collaboration moments -->

### Phase 3: Student - "Teach me"

And then one day you realize: they have something you don't. Something you want. Something you need to learn.

This isn't about them knowing more facts or being better at technology. It's about character traits, ways of being in the world, that you aspire to.

<!-- TODO: Add the moment of realization -->

## What Zach teaches me

<!-- TODO: Specific traits and examples -->

**Curiosity without hesitation.** Zach just... tries things. Yellow Deli? Let's go. Random creamery? Why not. He doesn't overthink. He doesn't need to research it first. He just engages.

**Healthy pride without arrogance.** Reading hard books. Not wearing headphones so he can be present. Reading on the bus instead of scrolling. He's figured out how to feel good about being different without making it about being better than others.

**Presence.** He's actually there when he's there.

## What Amelia teaches me

<!-- TODO: Specific traits and examples -->

**Radical authenticity.** She wears a tail. Sometimes a mask. She doesn't ask permission to be herself. She just is.

**Physical confidence.** Quadrobics on the trampoline. Carrying kettlebells. Bear hugs. She inhabits her body fully.

**Emotional wisdom beyond her years.** She wants to be a couples counselor. At 10. And honestly? She'd probably be good at it.

## The emotional shift

What does it feel like when you realize your kid has something you want?

<!-- TODO: Explore the emotions here -->

There's pride, obviously. But also something else. A kind of... humility? Gratitude?

Maybe a little grief for the version of yourself that took so long to learn what they seem to know instinctively.

## Why this matters

This isn't just a cute observation about parenting. It's about staying alive, intellectually and emotionally.

The moment you stop learning from the people around you - including (especially?) the ones you raised - you start calcifying.

My kids keep me growing.
