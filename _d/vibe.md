Vibe coding is the name for letting the ai write your code. The magic lies in AI's ability to infer intent from vague inputâ€”say almost nothing, and it often gives you something surprisingly right. This works because you're granting it wide degrees of freedom; as long as you're flexible on the outcome, the model can generate plausible results from minimal cues. But that magic is fragile: on follow-up turns, or when you have a much tighter definition of correct, the inferred intent often changes, and the model applies a different set of constraints then you wanted or what it did previously, causing a cliff, or misery. Turns out this is the same as junior developers.

The key to making vibe coding as productive as possible is having specifications, and verification.

## The fix: Specifications

The key to success is specifying your many implicit constraints. And just like in real life, you don't know them all up, so build up the rules gradually. But I bet the learnings apply across projects so wwrite them out explicitly and then you can pply them to many projects.

For a comprehensive example of codified development practices and conventions, see [chop-conventions](https://github.com/idvorkin/chop-conventions), which demonstrates how to document and standardize development workflows.

### Business logic: PRD/User Stories

### Which changes go where: Architecture

### The "taste" of code: Clean Code Best Practices

### The "readability" of code: Language specific best practices

### The "environment" - Tool chains, CI/CD, Commit Hooks, etc

This includes your development environment setup, tooling configurations, and automated workflows. Having consistent, well-documented development environments is crucial for productive vibe coding.

Check out the [dev-setup](https://github.com/idvorkin/chop-conventions/tree/main/dev-setup) practices for examples of how to standardize development environments and tooling across projects.
