Vibe coding is the name for letting the ai write your code. The magic lies in AI's ability to infer intent from vague inputâ€”say almost nothing, and it often gives you something surprisingly right. This works because you're granting it wide degrees of freedom; as long as you're flexible on the outcome, the model can generate plausible results from minimal cues. But that magic is fragile: on follow-up turns, or when you have a much tighter definition of correct, the inferred intent often changes, and the model applies a different set of constraints then you wanted or what it did previously, causing a cliff, or misery. Turns out this is the same as junior developers.

The key to making vibe coding as productive as possible is having spefications, and verification.

## The fix: Specifications

The key to success is specifying your many implicit constraints. And just like in real life, you don't know them all up, so build up the rules gradually. But I bet the learnings apply across projects so wwrite them out explicitly and then you can pply them to many projects.
