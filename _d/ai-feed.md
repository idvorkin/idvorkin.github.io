Pretty common: I get a bag of links — a newsletter, a Twitter thread, a friend's Slack message. I open them all in tabs, skim, close most, and forget. Maybe one in ten sticks. The rest vanish into the consumption void.

This is my attempt to fix that using AI as a reading partner. Instead of the tab-explosion-and-forget cycle, I paste links into Claude Code, which fetches, summarizes, predicts what I'll like, and captures everything here. Later, when I actually read the good ones, I come back and debrief — recording what resonated and what didn't.

It's [GTD](/gtd) capture meets AI triage. And unlike passive consumption, this process produces something: a public record of what I read, what I think about it, and how my taste evolves. That makes it [production, not consumption](/produce-consume).

## What I Gravitate Toward

_This section evolves as patterns emerge from what I read and skip._

Still calibrating — check back after a few sessions.
