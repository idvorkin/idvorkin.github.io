I like to begin with the end in mind, so let's write a report for 2026. This hasn't happened, but if I don't write it out and focus on it, it certainly won't.

### Major Projects

#### What I wished I knew at 32 and what I knew at 32

Notes:

- Start with what I wish I knew at 32
- Consider making TikToks
- Consider making TikTok version of [what I wish I knew at 22](/22)

Another memorable family vacation.

See [shoulder pain](/shoulder-pain) for recovery plan. Continuing hip mobility and glute med work from 2025.

#### Emotional Health

Restarted meditation and journalling on 12/30/2025. Maintain the momentum.

| Metric        | Goal     | Jan      | June | Dec | Status |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- | ---- | --- | ------ |

| Journalling   | Daily    | Restart  | -    | -   | -      |
| Gratefulness  | Daily    | Sporadic | -    | -   | -      |

#### Spiritual Health

Deepen my awareness and concentration through rebuilding my meditation practice for both skills and spirituality.

**Q1 2026 Goals:**

1. Restart daily meditation practice
2. Read "Awareness" by Anthony De Mello
3. Read "Waking Up" by Sam Harris

**Longer-term goals to define:**

- Build consistent concentration practice (Samatha) - keeping focus from paging out
- Develop awareness practice (Vipassana) - observing without judgment
- Explore the intersection of meditation and spiritual insight
- Figure out what spiritual growth means for me beyond just stress reduction

#### Magic

2025: Learned tricks but barely performed. 2026: Level up and get back out there.

- Go from finding a "Picked Card" to a "Thought of Card"
- Restart performing for strangers
- Ballooning while travelling

#### Identity Health

2025: Tony won on biking. Goofy shirts strong. Ballooning weak.

- Biking: Get back on the bike despite the Tesla temptation
- Keep the goofy shirts and mismatched crocs going
- Balloon more, especially while travelling

#### Work

- [Keep work at work](/mind-at-home-body-at-work) - The bar isn't "not checking my phone at home." It's not thinking about work—not replaying the tough conversation I'm afraid of, not being angry at something that triggered me.
