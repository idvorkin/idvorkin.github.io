I like to begin with the end in mind, so let's write a report for 2026. This hasn't happened, but if I don't write it out and focus on it, it certainly won't.

## Major Projects

### What I wished I knew at 32 and what I knew at 32

Notes:

- Start with what I wish I knew at 32
- Consider making TikToks

### Spiritual Health

Deepen my awareness and concentration through rebuilding my meditation practice for both skills and spirituality.

**Q1 2026 Goals:**
1. Restart daily meditation practice
2. Read "Awareness" by Anthony De Mello
3. Read "Waking Up" by Sam Harris

**Longer-term goals to define:**
- Build consistent concentration practice (Samatha) - keeping focus from paging out
- Develop awareness practice (Vipassana) - observing without judgment
- Explore the intersection of meditation and spiritual insight
- Figure out what spiritual growth means for me beyond just stress reduction

Related reading: [Awareness](/awareness), [Search Inside Yourself](/siy), [Spiritual Health](/spiritual-health)

### Magic

2025: Learned tricks but barely performed. 2026: Level up and get back out there.

- Go from finding a "Picked Card" to a "Thought of Card"
- Restart performing for strangers
- Ballooning while traveling

### Identity Health

2025: Tony won on biking. Goofy shirts strong. Ballooning weak.

- Biking: Get back on the bike despite the Tesla temptation
- Keep the goofy shirts and mismatched crocs going
- Balloon more, especially while traveling

### Family Time & Rituals

**Phase 1 Awareness**: Kids home for limited time. This window closes.

- Weekly 1-on-1 rituals with each family member
- Whole family rituals (date nights, Sunday dinner)
- Q1-Q2: Experiment and solidify rhythms
- Q3-Q4: Make rituals non-negotiable

**Success Metrics:**

| Ritual         | Goal    | Q1  | Q2  | Q3  | Q4  |
| -------------- | ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Kid 1-on-1s    | Weekly  | -   | -   | -   | -   |
| Family date    | Weekly  | -   | -   | -   | -   |
| Home by 6pm    | 5d/week | -   | -   | -   | -   |

## Review Cadence: Fighting Dragons While Working

The gap year framework applies even while working - the dragons don't disappear just because work gives you excuses. Work doesn't solve the dragon problems; it just hides them behind legitimate reasons.

**The Three Dragons:**

- **Entropy**: "Everything decays" - Without structure, health/habits/relationships degrade
- **Squander**: "You're wasting this" - Time slips away on what doesn't matter
- **Scarcity**: "There's never enough" - Anxiety about resources (time, money, energy)

Work keeps dragons boxed with built-in excuses. Fighting them while working requires explicit infrastructure.

### Weekly Review

**When:** Sundays, 30 minutes

**Dragon Check:**

- **Entropy**: Did I hit gym 5x? Sleep 9pm-5am? Family dates happened?
- **Squander**: Did I create any artifacts? Make progress on projects?
- **Scarcity**: Any financial anxiety? (quick check, not obsessive)

**Non-Negotiables Scorecard:**

- Gym: X/5 days
- Sleep window (9pm-5am): X/7 nights
- Family rituals: X/3 (individual + family)
- Home by 6pm: X/5 days
- Project time: X hours

**Adjust for next week:** What blocked me? What needs protection from work demands?

### Monthly Dragon Council

**When:** Last Sunday of month, 60 minutes

**Deep Dive:**

- **Physical health**: On track for goals? (weight, strength, flexibility)
- **Emotional health**: Meditation consistency? Journaling? Mental state?
- **Family**: Are rituals deepening relationships or just checking boxes?
- **Projects**: Real progress or just busy work?

**Which Dragon Won This Month?**

- If **Entropy**: What structure broke down? How to reinforce?
- If **Squander**: What did I waste time on? What artifact can I create?
- If **Scarcity**: What financial anxiety surfaced? Is it real or dragon noise?

**Metrics Review:**

- Update all tables in this document with actual data
- Calculate trends (improving, stable, declining?)

**Trip Wires (Red Flags):**

- Gym < 4x/week for 2 consecutive weeks
- Missed family rituals 2+ weeks in a row
- No project artifacts for a month
- Weight trend wrong direction 2 months

→ **Action**: Explicit choice - what will I say NO to at work?

### Quarterly Strategic Review

**When:** End of Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4

**The Big Questions:**

1. Am I winning against the dragons, or just surviving?
2. What worked this quarter? What failed?
3. What needs to change for next quarter?
4. Am I investing in what matters, or just coasting with work excuses?

**Ritual Assessment:**

- Which family rituals stuck? Which need adjustment?
- Are kids actually opening up, or just showing up?
- Quality of family time vs. quantity?

**Project Progress:**

- AI Projects: What shipped? What learned?
- Content Creation: What published? Who did it reach?
- Time.ltd: Is it actually helping or just an idea?

**Health Capital:**

- Physical metrics trending right direction?
- Emotional practices consistent or sporadic?
- Energy level higher or lower than last quarter?

**Year-End Review (December 2026):**
Looking back at "Stuff I'm really proud of" - can I fill it in honestly?
Or did the dragons win while I made excuses?

### Family Time & Rituals

**Phase 1 Awareness**: Both kids home for ~3 years (ages 47-50). This window closes.

**Individual Rituals:**

*With Zach (weekly):*
- Sunday breakfast (his choice of place)
- Tech project time (teaching him what you know)
- Goal: Deep 1-on-1 where he opens up

*With Amelia (weekly):*
- Tuesday dinner (her choice)
- [Her interest] time - what's her thing right now?
- Goal: Being the safe person she can talk to

*With Tori:*
- Weekend morning coffee/walk
- Monthly date beyond kid logistics
- Continuing what works

**Whole Family Rituals:**
- Friday family date night (rotating who picks)
- Sunday family dinner (all devices off)
- Summer vacation (memorable, not just travel)

**Establishing in 2026:**
- Q1: Experiment with different rhythms, find what sticks
- Q2: Solidify the weekly rituals
- Q3-Q4: Make them so routine they're non-negotiable

**Success Metrics:**

| Ritual | Goal | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 |
|--------|------|----|----|----|----|
| Zach 1-on-1 | Weekly | - | - | - | - |
| Amelia 1-on-1 | Weekly | - | - | - | - |
| Family date | Weekly | - | - | - | - |
| Home by 6pm | 5d/week | - | - | - | - |
