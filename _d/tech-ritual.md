There is so much change in tech it's important to check in on what has changed to make sure you're still using the latest. You can do this at an ad-hoc basis, but you're probably better off having it on a calendar.

  - Woah, most important thing, is Jupyter works very well in vs.code now, renders very pretty, totally usable.

Task: Go in and update my health tracking jupyter notebooks.

Goals:

- Make sure my health is still trending good :)
- Good chance to see what's new in Jupyter/Pandas/Python world.

### Linters/Formatters/Pre-Commit Hooks

- Pre-commit is a great project, pushing as much to the machine as you can.
