I've just switched jobs, so I'm hearing that a lot. I'll be honest, for a bit I was feeling the same thing.

You are asking the wrong question - the question you should be asking are:

Why do you respect your boss?

Does your team have open and clear communication?
How do you know your boss cares about your career?
Does your team have clear goals?

The difference within teams in a company are bigger than the differences between companies.
