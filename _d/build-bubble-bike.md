What the heck is a bubble bike? Ah, you see, bringing joy for others is my thing. As they say in Buddhism there are many vehicles to bring joy, and my vehicle is the bubble bike.

## Custom Bubble machine

{% include youtube.html src="hFaoC1UoGJ4" %}

- Problem #1 attaching to bike

  - Tori made a custom holder to hold and ratchet to the bike and remove.

- Problem #2 - Portal, and Powerful.

  - Tried all USB-powered bubble machines on AMZN
  - USB bubble machine with high power, bought like 4 of them.
  - Only 10 w
  - Big USB battery

- Problem #3 - All the bubble juice sloshing out

  - 2 water bottle holders, Carry bubble juice concentrate
  - 3D printed for more capacity and mostly cover
  - 3D print leaks, cover in tape
  - Make a funnel hole with a stopper

- Problem #4 - Froth making bubbles useless

  - Add baffles
  - Try using bubble anti-frothing

- Problem #5 - Bubble machine melting
  - Likely a function of the type of plastic used. Will try another.

## Many of the steps and challenges
