## Concepts

### The fuel of productivity, is energy.

### Match task to energy

No point spending "my high energy/willpower time" on a low energy activity. It's funny, my strongest energy is when I wake up, which seems like a waste to spend on the gym, except when I don't spend that on the gym it makes a mess.

### Drip, Drip, Drip - it adds up

### Realistic Expectations
