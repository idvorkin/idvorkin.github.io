## Concepts

### The fuel of productivity, is energy.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/energy" %}

### Match task to energy

No point spending "my high energy/willpower time" on a low energy activity. It's funny, my strongest energy is when I wake up, which seems like a waste to spend on the gym, except when I don't spend that on the gym it makes a mess.

### Stay balanced

{%include summarize-page.html src="/balance" %}

### Shape the path, leverage habits

{%include summarize-page.html src="/switch" %}

### Drip, Drip, Drip - it adds up

### Motivation

[Momentum is emotional gravity](/energy#momentum-is-emotional-gravity). The feeling of shipping, completing, moving forward—it compounds. When you're making progress, everything feels lighter. When you're stuck, everything feels heavier than it is. Forward motion creates its own fuel.

### Realistic Expectations

### Flow
