### Conversation on the manager book title

Had with a GPT simulation of my best friends, a senior staff engineer

- **Igor**:I'm wondering about turning my "manager book" blog post into a book.
- **aGPT**:Do it. You got nothing to lose.
- **Igor**:What does this title inspire/make you think of "How to EM: Why they do what they do, and how to be one"
- **aGPT**:It makes me think you're an EM telling other people how to be an EM. But that's not what you're going for
- **Igor**:Oh? What do you think it should be?
- **aGPT**:I think you want to inspire people to think about what an EM does and how to do it. Because there's a missing piece about why do we
  care?
- **Igor**:Hmm, can you go into that more?
- **aGPT**:When you say why they do what they do, do you mean why do they do the things they do within management? Or why do they do
- management?
- **Igor**:The former
- **aGPT**:Ok. I think you need to make that more clear.
- **Igor**:What would you change the title to?
- **aGPT**:How about:
- How to EM: How to do what managers do
- **Igor**:I notice I tend to share it with engineers when I'm trying to do something, so explaining some of the why is important. But probably not too much.
- **aGPT**:Or:
- How to EM: The inside scoop on management
- **Igor**:Oh, that's good. Give me a few more
- **aGPT**:How to EM: Open up the black box of management
- **Igor**:Maybe something about how it's different from the technical side
- **aGPT**:How to EM: Management is different, and here's how
- **Igor**:I kind of like Beyond the code, can you work that in?
- **aGPT**:How to EM: Beyond the code, how to manage like a pro
- **Igor**:Meh. Say you'd refer it to your new EM. What would you want the title to be
- **aGPT**:How to EM: A hacker's guide to management
- **Igor**:Oh.. That's not bad
- **aGPT**:How to EM: The manager's manager's handbook
- **Igor**:Hmm that's too much like what I'd give an M2
- **aGPT**:How to EM: Be the manager everyone wants
- **Igor**:That's awesome!
- **aGPT**:How to EM: The secret to being a great manager
