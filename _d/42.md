# Pondering Retirement

Less about retirement, more about financial indpendance
Fuck you money

### Some lies about [retirement](retirement.md)

Here are lies we tell ourselves

- "Work" is preventing you from doing the things you love
- You can self motivate your self
- You won't death spiral
- You have enough social intereaction
- You have enough meaning
- You have enough structure

# Who this talk is for

Unlike the other talks, this one I'm writing when I'm 45, so it's pretty relevant to me in real time. Hopefully others will find it helpful as well.

# Balance

# Health -

All those financial models from your 20s thinking about paying debt and saving for retirement, that all applies to your health.

- Non-disposable ~~income~~ health - You need health to do basic things like walking around, getting out of bed, and opening cans.
- Your ~~income~~ health generating ability declines, and you need large savings to draw from
- Sometimes you don't enjoy building ~~income~~ health, but you need to do it anyways

- The health debt you likely took on in your 30s need to be paid back otherwise you'll degrade quickly.
- Your body is no longer forgiving of incorrect movements, and healing is much harder.
  - Remember that your body is now at 75%. Marathons and deadlifts need to take a back seat to low-impact routines.
  - Find a way to exercise that works for you,

* Get that lump checked out, do a full blood panel.
* Eat mostly fruits and vegetables, and try not to eat too much.

# Themes

### Optimizing vs Satisfying

# Decline - the self-fulfilling prophecy

# Some ideas from Ammon

- Money isn’t everything. Try to get enough money, then turn your focus to other pursuits. While you’re getting enough money, don’t forget everything else.
- Of all the skills you can develop, kindness and compassion are the most important. Try as hard as you can to keep this in mind when interacting with your parents, your partners, your children, your coworkers, and strangers.

# more ideas

- This is your peak earnings, and peak productivity. You've got maximum experience and minimal mental decline.
- As you get older, you will decline, the work you do in your 40s will be the starting point for your decline, and simultaneously impact your rate of decline.
