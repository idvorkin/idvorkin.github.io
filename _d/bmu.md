The business model canvas is a tool for understanding how a company makes money. This same model can be applied to a person's career. While [job hunting](/job-hunt-stress) this was helpful figuring out my [dream job](/dream-job). I suppose it should also prioritize my [work energy](/boss), and probably how to prioritize my [life energy](/eulogy). But that's to come.
