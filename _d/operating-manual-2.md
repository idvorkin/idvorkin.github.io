I've learned what I like, how I want to spend my energy, and how I want to be thinking about my life. I've learned my roles, reasonable expectations, and healthy ways to operate given my personality, behaviors, and frequently occurring situations. This post is a summary of those learnings - an operating manual if you will, reminding me how to think about, respond to and behave, so I can operate at maximum effectiveness and efficiency. Super important: You don't rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.

## Some philosophy and fortune cookies

### On goals, aspiration and systems

- You don't rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.
- Goals without systems are just good intentions.
- Do you want Planning/High Discipline Igor making decisions, or evening Igor making the decisions (See [Brian Johnson](/blueprint)).

### On Rituals

_Copied from someone smart_

> I learned over time that ritualizing ordinary moments makes them sacred. And when something becomes sacred, you give it meaning, and things with meaning reflect meaning back to you.

Rituals create a virtuous cycle: by treating something as important, it becomes important. By giving meaning to ordinary moments, those moments give meaning back to me. This transforms mundane activities into sources of energy, clarity, and purpose.

Regardless of your preferences, practice makes permanent, and ritual will be created. This will either be by your conscious design, or by the resistance. You choose explicitly, or implicitly by not thinking about it. By designing your rituals, you can maximize your life, with minimal energy.

Rituals is an instantiation of practice makes permanent.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/new-skills"%}

Rituals can be not mindless drudgery, they are the invisible software that runs. Be it optimal, or be mal-adaptive, it'll be running, so think it through and make it great.

### Anchors and Clips: Why Climbers Don’t Plummet to Their Death

Climbers don’t just muscle their way up a rock face hoping for the best. They climb with a system designed to expect and absorb failure.

As they climb, they clip their rope into anchors—strong points bolted into the rock or secured using gear like cams or nuts. These aren’t optional. They’re non-negotiable safety systems.

When they slip—and they often do—the rope catches them. The fall might jolt, they might swing, but they don’t fall far. More importantly: they don’t fall all the way down.

Why? Because they planned for the fall. No climber trusts themselves never to mess up. They trust their system to catch them when they do.

And That’s Exactly How Habits Should Work

Too many people build habits like free soloists—no backup, no safety. It’s “do it every day” or “fail completely.” But that’s not sustainable.

Real habit-building is like climbing with anchors. Expect you’ll miss a few days, lose motivation, get busy. So you build in habit anchors—small, strategic commitments that keep you from falling all the way off the wall. What are you anchor and clips

## Calendar - 2024 H2

As a younger man I hated calendars and structure. I still don't love them, but I have limited decision making/discipline energy/capability per day, and when I'm out of that energy, I just vegetate. So TL;DR: figure out what you want, and schedule it. Then don't think about it.

## Morning Routine

At my best, I roll out of bed either when my eyes open or at 5am, whatever comes first. Then I sit in front of my [mood lamp](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PCN4UVU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and drink my cold brew nitro coffee.

_Ah when the kids were younger - I also loved getting my morning hug from my kids, but now that Zach's older (9), I'm down to just getting the hugs from Amelia - who is 5._

### Daily Affirmations

Every day I should start with my affirmations

{%include summarize-page.html src="/affirmations"%}

### Weekend morning routine

On the weekends, the gym opens at 8, so it's essential I drink my coffee in my home office chair so I can work on whatever is most important to me, often reading or writing. At 7:30 it's time to drag my butt to the gym.

Post gym I'll either hit the coffee shop to do some more writing, or head home to spend the day with my family.

### Weekday morning routine

At my best, I roll out of bed either when my eyes open or at 5am, whatever comes first.

The gym opens at 5:30, and I try to be there by 6.

**Walking kids to school** has been one of my most cherished morning activities. Whether it's a block away or to the bus stop, these 10-minute walks have consistently been a major quality of life improvement. The kids really appreciate it, and it's amazing how this small investment of time can have such an impact on my relationship with my family.

**2025:** Now that Zach is in high school, I walk him to the bus stop. I used to also walk Amelia to the bus stop, but I realized I could actually drive her to school with [Tony](/tony) - it's zero stress on me, and I get an extra 10 minutes with Amelia.

**2024:** Now that Zach and Amelia go to different schools, I walk Zach to the city bus stop and Amelia to the school bus stop. I'm very lucky the drops are staggered by an hour so I can do both drops, giving me dedicated one-on-one time with each kid.

**2022:** After my workout, I go to work so I'm done at 4pm.

**Pre - 2021:** After my workout, I often chillax with my next priority being walking kids to school. Walking the kids to school has surprisingly been a major quality of life improvement for a very small impact to my day.

### Morning Kryptonite

I have three common failure modes in my morning routine:

- Starting my day by sitting in my easy chair drinking my coffee. This mindless activity has me skipping those things that are important to me.
- Hitting snooze when my alarm goes off. The worst of all worlds, not sleeping, and not being up and doing stuff.
- Lying in bed awake when I wake up before 5. Sometimes I wake up and can't fall back asleep @ 3 or 4 (which isn't crazy because sometimes I go to bed @ 7 or 8). Similar to hitting snooze, I'm not sleeping, and I'm not accomplishing anything.

### Morning Refreshers

Instead of thinking about working out as a chore, I reframe it as a refresher - a way to energize and reset myself. I have different levels of refreshers:

- **Refresher**: [Training at the gym](/physical-health) - the foundation of feeling energized and ready for the day
- **Refresher Plus**: Training at the gym followed by quality time at the coffee shop - combining physical energy with mental space
- **Refresher Supreme**: The ultimate morning reset - coffee shop time, gym training, and [meditation](/siy) - nurturing body, mind, and spirit

_Note: The coffee shop represents a mental state - focused, relaxed, and ready to think deeply. While I currently need the physical coffee shop to enter this state, I'm working on being able to deliberately enter this state anywhere._

### Daily Journaling

My morning coffee shop time is when I do my [daily journaling](/process-journal). This practice helps me process my thoughts, set intentions for the day, and maintain mental clarity.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/process-journal" %}

## After Work Routine

My discipline is strong in the morning, but by the time I get home from work, I'm usually energy and willpower depleted.

### Post work routine

- I can fight my lack of willpower with a schedule.
- Current schedule, 1 day Zach date, 1 day Amelia date, 1 day friend date
- Get a healthy snack - popcorn or vegetables (not a huge container of fruit)

### Post work Kryptonite

- Sitting in my easy chair, mindlessly on my phone
- Eating continuously

## My Super Powers

{%include summarize-page.html src="/strengths" %}

**Activator** - People who are especially talented in the Activator theme can
make things happen by turning thoughts into action. They are
often impatient.

**Communication** - People who are especially talented in the Communication
theme generally find it easy to put their thoughts into words.
They are good conversationalists and presenters.

**Restorative** - People who are especially talented in the Restorative theme are
adept at dealing with problems. They are good at figuring out
what is wrong and resolving it.

### Relationships

- Investing time in relationships always pays out. It can feel expensive, but it's always worth it.

### Technical Depth and Breadth

### Technical Best Practice

### Ability to sanity test all tech stuff

## My Kryptonite

### Bean counting

### Committing and describing relative to ideal, not relative to reality

### Underestimating technical complexity

## Health and Habits

Health - physical, emotional, cognitive, and spiritual - is easy to understand but hard to maintain. My strategy to maintain health is through [habits](/habits), but thanks to the [immutable laws of hard things](/Immutable-Laws-Of-Hard), habits degrade without constant vigilance.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/four-healths" %}

{%include summarize-page.html src="/Immutable-Laws-Of-Hard" %}

I spend lots of time thinking about how I should be working my habits, but often end up not doing them. In this case, the key is to stop moaning and restart them.

I've already got enough hobbies - biking, magic, juggling. I get my biking fix no problem.

## Cognitive Reframe Upgrades

The words you use influence how you think.

- I'm under water --> I'm fully booked this week
- I'm not doing a good job --> When I'm at my best I do
- I manage the XYZ team -> I support the XYZ team
- This is crap --> [Help me understand](/compassion)
- How could they -> I wish to remove their suffering

{%include summarize-page.html src="/some" %}

## Bad Influences

Don't give a guy trying to lose weight an ice cream maker. An ice cream maker sounds great, but if it facilitates things that you don't want it's double bad.

### Luxury Car

~~I've been dying to get a Tesla, full self driving and some luxury. But what's most important to my identity is biking, and not driving a car. To quote my friend Ammon - Igor you getting a tesla is like getting an ice cream maker. You need to decide your priority and go from there.~~

Turns out, I love this now. Check out

{%include summarize-page.html src="/tesla" %}

### Sports cars

On my trip to [FISM](/timeoff-2022-07), the cheapest car to rent ended up being a fancy sports car. It accelerated like butter, braked on a dime, and had gear shifting paddles in full sports mode. I soon realized I could weave through traffic going 60 miles an hour easily playing peek-a-boo with regular cars.

I realized 1/ no value to me in this 2/ chance of getting into or causing an accident 3/ chance of me focusing on anger that someone else is playing peek-a-boo with me and winning.

## Triggers and Mental Quicksand

Like most folks, I have triggers and mental quicksand which I can get trapped in. Here are some of mine, and things I need to remember. This also reminds me of the:

### Stress and Anxiety

{%include summarize-page.html src="/anxiety" %}

### Coronavirus

My gosh, this is sucking up lots of brain power. I don't think I get value thinking about this. I have two choices: stop thinking about this, _OR_ write a post on all my thoughts on this.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/covid" %}

### Raising kids

#### Physical Health

{%include summarize-page.html src="/physical-health" %}

#### Not spending enough time with them

When it comes to family, like all things, it's easy to confuse hours for quality. Being at home playing on his tablet, while the kids played on theirs wasn't family time. Instead Igor realized the key is having dates, a time he gave the gift of his complete attention to Amelia, Zach and Tori. Date nights were sacred and could be whatever the kid wanted. Here's a [nice date night](/ig66/587)

![montage](https://github.com/idvorkin/blob/raw/master/ig66/587/montage.jpg)

#### Diet and Weight

{%include summarize-page.html src="/diet" %}

### Financial Security

{%include summarize-page.html src="/money" %}

#### The point of [money](/money)

Money isn't just to make piles; it's to enable you to do stuff. Stuff does not equal stuff you don't use; stuff is actually often experiences. And most of the best stuff you can't buy. Yup, it's doing and it's with whom you are doing it.

#### What would I do for less money

If you wouldn't take a job for a pay cut, you probably shouldn't take the job.

#### Making more vs spending more

See [Parkinson's law](/parkinson), which applies to both time and money.
