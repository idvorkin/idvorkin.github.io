It's spring break 2023! The kids and I are going to Canada to see Baba, Yelena, Justin, Sam and Baltasar and Rada's Family. Unfortunately Tori can't come as she's critical to her play opening and it'll be opening that week.

To get the most out of my time off, I'm going to follow my best practice of pre-writing what I want to get done, and adjust it as I go. This is a combination of [time off](/time-off), and all the stuff for [happiness](/happy), which I guess gets tangled up with half of my evergreen notes.

Humorously, I can just copy much of my todo from last year as it's pretty similar!

## My top priorities

### Health and Habits

- ☑ Get a gym membership and go every other day at least
  - ☐ Do the ice bath
- ☑ Bring travel scale
- ☐ Get popcorn maker
- ☑ Get boiled eggs and cucumbers
