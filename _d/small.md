### RE:Work

#### 1. Start Small and Stay Simple

- **Build Less**: Avoid overcomplicating your product or business; focus on what’s essential.
- **Minimal Planning**: Create quick, actionable plans rather than overly detailed, long-term strategies.
- **Launch Now**: Don’t wait for perfection; release your product and improve based on feedback.

#### 2. Focus on Doing

- **No Excuses**: You don’t need a large team, a fancy office, or a massive budget to start a business.
- **Action Over Ideas**: Execution matters more than brainstorming the “perfect” idea.
- **Avoid Meetings**: Most meetings are unnecessary. Communicate through simple, direct methods.

#### 3. Work Smarter, Not Harder

- **Say No**: Learn to say no to anything that doesn’t align with your core goals.
- **Be a Curator**: Prioritize the few things that truly matter.
- **Avoid Burnout**: Work at a sustainable pace to maintain long-term productivity.

#### 4. Marketing by Teaching

- **Share Knowledge**: Educate your customers instead of focusing on traditional ads.
- **Transparency Wins**: Be open and honest; customers value authenticity.
- **Embrace Your Audience**: Your niche audience is your strength—speak directly to them.

#### 5. Reframe Competition

- **Ignore the Competition**: Focus on improving your own business instead of obsessing over others.
- **Be Unique**: Stand out by being different, not by copying.
- **Underdo the Competition**: Offer less but do it better.

#### 6. Customer-Centric Approach

- **Make It Easy**: Focus on creating a simple and intuitive user experience.
- **Cut Out the Middleman**: Build direct relationships with customers.
- **Happy Customers Market You**: Great products and services naturally create word-of-mouth.

#### 7. Embrace Constraints

- **Constraints Inspire Creativity**: Limited resources force you to think innovatively.
- **Don’t Wait for Perfection**: Constraints help you prioritize what’s essential.

#### 8. Forget Growth for Growth’s Sake

- **Small is Fine**: A small, profitable business is better than a large, unsustainable one.
- **Grow Organically**: Focus on steady improvement rather than explosive expansion.
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Don’t chase customers who aren’t a good fit for your business.

#### 9. Culture and Team

- **Hire Less**: Only add people when absolutely necessary.
- **Hire Doers**: Look for self-motivated individuals who get things done.
- **Be Flexible**: Allow autonomy and encourage creative solutions.

The authors argue for a less-is-more approach to business. They promote practicality, sustainability, and staying true to your core values while rejecting common business clichés.
