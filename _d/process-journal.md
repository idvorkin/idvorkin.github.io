I've been doing [daily stream of consciousness journaling](/emotional-health#daily-stream-of-consciousness-journaling) since 2011, writing over a million words. Here's how I think about processing and analyzing my journal entries.

## Handwriting vs Typing

## Automated Analysis

## Weekly Report

## Process for 2025

I've always loved handwriting my journal entries - there's something special about the tactile experience and the way it helps me think. However, I previously switched to typing because being able to analyze and [search my daily journals](https://github.com/idvorkin/nlp/blob/cbc8dd8094b3d4e3a7331846538e5e945745baef/life.py#L337) was incredibly valuable.

Now, thanks to AI transcription capabilities, I can have the best of both worlds. Here's my Current Daily Workflow:

1. Create a new notebook in my Kindle Scribe, named with the current date
2. Spend 10 minutes handwriting my stream of consciousness
3. Send the handwritten notes as an email
4. Use AI to [convert the handwriting to text](https://github.com/idvorkin/nlp/blob/cbc8dd8094b3d4e3a7331846538e5e945745baef/journal.py#L34)
5. Copy the transcribed text into my daily journal file
6. [Extract TODOs](https://github.com/idvorkin/settings/blob/6ce73103b714e5b08ba19dc19856fc5a8ea549fc/py/todo_to_omnifocus.py?plain=1#L28) and move them to OmniFocus
7. Check yesterday's TODOs in OmniFocus and yesterday's Habit Tracker in Streaks app to prime my daily journal

This process preserves the benefits of handwriting (better thinking, more personal) while maintaining the ability to search, analyze, and process my journal entries digitally. It's a perfect blend of the analog and digital worlds.

### Journal Structure

Each journal entry follows a consistent template with sections that help me reflect on different aspects of my life:

**Commitments**

_I don't do this but should_

What I committed to yesterday, and if I did it. This would be great to build a review cycle into my workflows.

**Day awesome if**

Listing out things I want done today.

TODO: Really think through what matters, and only put it in if I'll do it.

**Yesterday was awesome because**
Remembering what made yesterday great - the specific events and accomplishments that made it special, building [momentum](/be-proactive).

**Journal**
The main stream of consciousness section where I process my thoughts and feelings.

**Grateful for**
Daily gratitude practice structured around God, Others, and Self (Igor).

{% include summarize-page.html src="/grateful" %}

**Affirmations**
Reinforcing positive beliefs and mindsets I want to cultivate.

{% include summarize-page.html src="/affirmations" %}

**Psychic Weight**
Processing any mental burdens or concerns that are weighing on my mind.

{% include summarize-page.html src="/psychic-weight" %}

This structure helps ensure I cover key areas of reflection each day, from setting intentions to practicing gratitude and processing any mental burdens.
