Ever wish you could high-five your past self for that brilliant decision, or maybe gently smack them for that questionable haircut? While we haven't cracked the physics of time travel yet, we're actually time traveling every day - through our memories, choices, and regrets. Think of it as a group chat between Past Igor (that sweet summer child), Present Igor (hello!), and Future Igor (hopefully with better fashion sense). Let's explore how these three versions of ourselves are constantly chatting, arguing, and occasionally giving each other virtual fist bumps across the space-time continuum.

## Overview

There are three ways we time travel with ourselves:
- Reminiscing about our past
- Experiencing our present 
- Anticipating our future

Often these get confused and tangled together.

## The Marshmallow Test

[Content about delayed gratification and how it relates to our past/future selves]

## The Regrets Framework 

[Content about common regrets and how to avoid them by making decisions our future self would thank us for]

## Optimizing for Tomorrow vs Feeling Good Today

The eternal balance - how do we make choices that serve both our present and future selves?

## Work/Life Balance Through Time

How our perspective on work/life balance shifts through different phases of life.

## Bad Uses of Time

### Creating Twice
[Content about inefficient rework]

### Under/Over Preparing 
Just because you can prepare more doesn't mean you should.

### The Eulogy Paradox
Writing your eulogy doesn't mean everything happens - it's an aspiration, not a guarantee.
