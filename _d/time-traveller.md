## Overview

There are three ways we time travel with ourselves:
- Reminiscing about our past
- Experiencing our present 
- Anticipating our future

Often these get confused and tangled together.

## The Marshmallow Test

[Content about delayed gratification and how it relates to our past/future selves]

## The Regrets Framework 

[Content about common regrets and how to avoid them by making decisions our future self would thank us for]

## Optimizing for Tomorrow vs Feeling Good Today

The eternal balance - how do we make choices that serve both our present and future selves?

## Work/Life Balance Through Time

How our perspective on work/life balance shifts through different phases of life.

## Bad Uses of Time

### Creating Twice
[Content about inefficient rework]

### Under/Over Preparing
