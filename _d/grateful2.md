### Quick Simple Prompts

Every day I try to write 3 prompts in the form of:

I'm grateful for X, To God because Y, to Other because Z, to myself because A.

- **The element**: To build my muscle
- **To God**: To build my appreciation for wonder in the universe
- **To Other**: To build my appreciation and compassion for others and their contribution
- **To Myself**: To reinforce my good habits and behavior.

However, these start to get repetitive and stale quickly.
