title: Time off Mid winter break 2022
---

It'mid winter break and I've got a week off. In an attempt to maximize my personal development and satisfaction during my time off, by staying balanced, and minimizing my vegetation I'm going to pre-write what I want to get done, and adjust it as I go.

This is a combination of [time off](/time-off), and all the stuff for [happiness](/happy), which I guess gets tangled up with half of my evergreen notes.

My top priorities:

- Restart cardio and magic.
- Figure out tools to create more balance
- Create moments with the family (and take Selfies of them)

## Moments

-

## Success Stories

- Wrote up my plan the weekend before.
- Spent 4 hours on magic, multiple days in a row
- Did magic for a spectator at a bar
- Learning a new coin trick that is awesome!

- Tech/content time before the kids wake up is totally fine.
