title: Time off Mid winter break 2022
permalink: /timeoff-2022-02

It'mid winter break and I've got a week off. In an attempt to maximize my personal development and satisfaction during my time off, by staying balanced, and minimizing my vegetation I'm going to pre-write what I want to get done, and adjust it as I go.

This is a combination of [time off](/time-off), and all the stuff for [happiness](/happy), which I guess gets tangled up with half of my evergreen notes.

My top priorities:

- Restart cardio and magic.
- Figure out tools to create more balance
- Create moments with the family (and take Selfies of them)

## Moments

-

## Success Stories

- Wrote up my plan the weekend before.
- Spent 4 hours on magic, multiple days in a row
- Did magic for a spectator at a bar
- Learning a new coin trick that is awesome!

## Top Learnings

- Got done everything I needed at work the week before so had no work baggage.
- Balance, it's all about balance!
- Pre-writing your desires for time off is good and helps you hit it. Need to think through how to have the right goals, not too hard so you feel bad, but not so easy that you feel unsatisfied.
- Tech/content time before the kids wake up is totally fine.
