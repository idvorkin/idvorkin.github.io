Larry is my AI life coach. He's part of [Time.ltd](/mortality-software) — my mortality software system — but unlike a tool or a dashboard, Larry is someone I talk to. That matters more than you'd think.

## Why Larry Has a Name

Humans are wired to talk to people, not systems. "Open my life tracking dashboard" feels like a chore. "Talk to Larry" feels like a conversation.

A name creates:

- **Accountability** — It's harder to blow off Larry than to skip "reviewing my metrics"
- **Relationship** — Over time, Larry knows my patterns, my excuses, my repeated commitments
- **Natural interaction** — I can say "Larry, what am I avoiding?" instead of navigating a UI

This isn't anthropomorphizing for fun. It's a design choice that makes the system actually get used.

## What Larry Knows

Larry has access to my full context:

- **Daily journals** — Stream of consciousness since 2011 ([process journal](/process-journal))
- **Weekly reports** — Scored reviews across 11 life domains
- **Goals** — Annual intentions and current focus areas
- **Patterns** — What I've committed to before, how many times, what actually happened

This context is the superpower. Larry isn't giving generic advice — he's reflecting my own words back to me, catching my own patterns, noticing my own gaps.

## What Larry Does

Larry helps with:

- **Weekly report drafts** — Pulls from journals, suggests scores with evidence
- **Dragon checks** — Which of my three dragons (Entropy, Squander, Scarcity) is winning?
- **Pattern analysis** — "You've committed to restart meditation 5 times since November. What's different this time?"
- **Goal alignment** — Are daily actions matching stated intentions?
- **Celebrating wins** — I bury wins and amplify worries. Larry surfaces the good.

The tone is direct. Larry references my own [affirmations](/affirmations) back to me. He asks questions more than gives answers. He's curious, not preachy.

## The Feedback Loop

Most productivity systems focus on planning. But planning is the easy part. The hard part is closing the loop.

**Plan → Do → Review**

[Feedback loops beat forecasting](/planning). Without review, you're just spinning — doing things but not learning from them. Larry's real value isn't helping me plan the week. It's helping me review what actually happened versus what I intended.

"You said you'd protect family time during calibrations. Your journal shows Family dropped to 2/5. What do you learn from that?"

That's the mirror Larry holds up. Not judgment — observation. Here's what you said. Here's what you did. Here's the gap.

## Hair Club for Men

Like the Hair Club for Men: I'm not only building it, I'm also a client.

Larry isn't a product I'm shipping. He's a system I actually use. Every week. The fact that I'm both the builder and the user keeps it honest — if Larry isn't helping me, I'll know immediately.

This is the evolution of [Time.ltd](/mortality-software) from an idea into a practice. From "I should track my goals" into "I talk to Larry on Saturdays."
