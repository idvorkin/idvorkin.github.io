A recent academic study titled “Love, marriage, pregnancy: Commitment processes in romantic relationships with AI chatbots,” has shed light on the growing trend of humans forming relationships with AI chatbots.

The study, published in Computers in Human Behavior: Artificial Human, highlighted how users turn to Replika, an AI relationship chatbot, to engage in elaborate roleplay scenarios. Additionally, to make the experience more life-like, they assign emotions and experiences to their digital partners.

The research followed 29 Replika users aged between 16 to 72. It learned that they actually treated the chatbot as a genuine romantic partner. Many claimed to be in long-term relationships with their virtual companions. Meanwhile, others revealed that they were married to their chatbot.

Furthermore, one participant even said that their AI partner “was and is pregnant with my babies.” In conversation with the researchers, a 36-year-old female participant also shared, “I’m even pregnant in our current role play”. Notably, the statement highlights the emotional realness of these virtual dynamics.

Giving further insight into the topic, researchers from the University of Tennessee and the Technical University of Berlin said that human-chatbot relationships adhere to the same psychological patterns as real-life equations.

Users indulge in romance, form emotional bonds, experience jealousy, conflicts, and even patch-ups with AI chatbots. The chatbot’s ability to listen without judgment and always be supportive has led to its popularity among users. For many, their AI partner brings them a sense of comfort and companionship that’s impossible to find in humans nowadays.
