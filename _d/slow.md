Why do they have these weird names?

- **Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS)**: The term "sympathetic" comes from the Greek word "sympathes," which means "having a fellow feeling" or "affected by the same disease." In the context of the nervous system, it refers to the idea that this system broadly activates various organs and tissues throughout the body to respond in a coordinated manner during stress.

- **Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS)**: The prefix "para-" means "beside" or "alongside." This indicates that the parasympathetic system works alongside the sympathetic nervous system but often in opposition to it. While the sympathetic system prepares the body for action, the parasympathetic system helps calm it down and maintain homeostasis.
