## Concepts

WAS3K, as usual, has an awesome post on [AR](https://vas3k.com/blog/augmented_reality/).

### AR vs VR vs MR vs IRL

### AR Cloud

### SLAM - Simultaneous Location and Mapping

Location and Mapping

### IMU - Inertial Measurement Unit

Where you are with a combo gyroscope and accelerometer

### VIO - Visual Inertial Odometry

Figuring out where you are by combo vision and inertial sensors

### 6 Dimensions X,Y,Z, Yaw, Pitch, Roll

Need to know where your device is in 6 dimensions, X,Y,Z and then rotation Pitch, Yaw, Roll

Y,P,R:

_An aircraft in flight is free to rotate in three dimensions: yaw, nose left or right about an axis running up and down; pitch, nose up or down about an axis running from wing to wing; and roll, rotation about an axis running from nose to tail. The axes are alternatively designated as vertical, transverse, and longitudinal respectively. These axes move with the vehicle and rotate relative to the Earth along with the craft._

### Multi Player AR

### ARKit vs ARCore

Google vs Apple.

### Plane Detection

### Point Clouds

### Visual vs Auditory

## Hardware

### Holo Lens

### Oculus Go

### Oculus Rift

### iPad Pro 2020 Depth Sensors

## Video call use cases

### Virtual Backgrounds

### Rabbit Ears

### AR Stickers

## Monetization

### Snapchat Event lenses - Geo Fence Lense

### Snapchat Branded lenses - Brand Entangled

### Merch Lenses

## Use Cases

### Measuring Distance

### Virtual Boxing

I accidentally punched a hole in my TV.

### Virtual Tennis

### Training

### Tele medicine

### Working in VR

## Philosophy

### The Matrix - Simulation

Funny quote from Elon Musk about being in a [simulation](https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/2/11837874/elon-musk-says-odds-living-in-simulation).

_If you assume any rate of improvement at all then games will become indistinguishable from reality," Musk said. "Even if that rate of advancement drops by a thousand from what it is now, let's just imagine it's 10,000 years in the future, which is nothing on the evolutionary scale." Given that we're on that trajectory and that these games are increasingly playable on any device, Musk said, the odds that we are living our lives in base reality — that is, "real" reality — is one in billions._

### Why is IRL better than VR

I think the big philosophical question, especially for AR, is why be IRL? After all, IRL is just nicer.
