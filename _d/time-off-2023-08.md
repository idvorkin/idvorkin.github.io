It's summer break 2023! It's late August and our last chance to get a vacation before the kids go back to school. We were going to go to Chilliwack to try a deli run by a small jewish cult, but alas it's like 100 degrees so we're going to to coast instead!

To get the most out of my time off, I'm going to follow my best practice of pre-writing what I want to get done, and adjust it as I go. This is a combination of [time off](/time-off), and all the stuff for [happiness](/happy), which I guess gets tangled up with half of my evergreen notes.

Humorously, I can just copy much of my todo from last year as it's pretty similar!

## My top priorities

### Back to generating artificats

- Bang out a daily blog post
- Write 4 family journal entries (!!)
- Finish my talk on AI

### Health and Habits

- I think I'm going to go easy on diet this trip (?)
- Go to grocery store and load up on healhty food
  - Boiled eggs and cuconumorres
  - Coleslaw
- Bring my travel scale
- Be OK going out for some meals and treats. But no gorging
- Huh, weird....
  - My brain wanted to go to store at 9pm and gorge
  - Went to store, bought stuff (mostly helahty)
  - but came home and was pretty full so didn't want to gorge
  - Wow, that was great.
