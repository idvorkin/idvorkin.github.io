Imagine sitting enjoying a picnic with a friend at the side of a river. Suddenly you see a kid drowning, you and your friend dive in and save him. A few minutes later the same thing happens. When the third kid comes down river, your friend runs away. You scream at him - why the hell aren't you helping. He replies, I'm running upstream to stop the bastard who's throwing kids into the river. Upstream is the idea of solving problems before they start. It's the basis of habit 3, First Things First, where we tackle the important not urgent.

This is my summary of [upstream](https://www.amazon.com/Upstream-Quest-Problems-Before-Happen/dp/1982134720)
