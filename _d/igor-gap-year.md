The gap year concept is compelling in theory, but what does it look like when rubber meets road? Here's my real-time wrestling match with the dragons guarding this treasure of time, complete with all the messy financial calculations, identity crises, and voice-in-head battles that come with considering a year off at 50.

This is the personal companion to my broader piece on [the gap year paradox](/gap-year) - where theory meets Igor's very specific neuroses and circumstances.

## Is Igor Gonna take a gap year?

{% include alert.html content="I'm incredibly privileged to have both line of sight on savings and the support of my family to even consider a gap year" style="info" %}

When I started at Meta in March 2020, my plan was to take a gap year after my Meta stock vested in 2024. After all, I had five job offers, including competitive offers from Google, Meta, and several mid-sized companies. But today's job market is much scarier than pre-COVID 2020 — it's become downright dicey out there.

But there's more to life than collecting money, here are some what ifs I need to remember:

What If ...

- I can only see my kid for N more years
- I am only able bodied for N more years.
- I am only alive for N more years.

So what's holding me back? Dragons! Early cartographers added dragons and other mythical beasts to regions that were unexplored or poorly understood, symbolizing danger, mystery, and the unknown. Thus early maps had "Here be dragons" ("HC SVNT DRACONES" in Latin) to mark uncharted territories.

## Does Igor want to retire?

I like to say I'd do 80% of my job for free (and you don't get to do them without doing that 20% I don't enjoy). Retirement doesn't really interest me. However, as I like to say [no one ever said they wished they worked more on their deathbed](/wlb-manifesto).

Family time is sacred, and work eats up a lot of energy. When there's no family time needed, I'm happy to (and probably prefer to) work.

Looking ahead from 2025 (I'm 47 now), I see three distinct phases:

**Phase 1: With Zach and Amelia Home (3 years, ages 47-50)**

- Both kids still living at home
- Maximum family time opportunity
- Work flexibility most critical

**Phase 2: With Amelia Home (4 years, ages 50-54)**

- Zach off to college, Amelia still home
- Transitional period with one child
- Balancing independence and presence

**Phase 3: Empty Nest (ages 54+)**

- Both kids launched into their own lives
- Time to work intensively again
- Different kind of fulfillment and focus

In Phase 3, I anticipate wanting to work extensively - but Phases 1 and 2 represent irreplaceable windows for deep family connection.

**Hey you're not talking about Tori, doesn't time with her matter?**

It certainly does, but Tori needs her own time, and our relationship is set up where we don't need a ton of time together.

**What about travel?**

Not my thing.

## Letting Your Dragons Out of the Box

The dragons (Financial Security, Decay, Loneliness) have always been there, but work kept them contained in a box. Not solved - just managed through a sophisticated system of legitimate cover.

Work provided three critical pieces of dragon management infrastructure:

- **Free excuses for neglecting yourself and your relationships**: "I'm too wiped out from that presentation to work out" or "I'll start eating better after this crazy project ends" or "I'll spend quality time with family once this deadline passes" - legitimate reasons to deprioritize personal growth and connection
- **Free connection to others**: Colleagues, meetings, hallway conversations, lunch partners - built-in social infrastructure that kept loneliness at bay without you having to create or maintain it
- **Free urgency and purpose**: Deadlines, projects, crises that gave your days automatic momentum and meaning without you having to generate it from within

These weren't lies or rationalizations. Work really does make it harder to maintain perfect health habits, nurture relationships, or address deeper personal questions. The excuses were often completely valid.

But the gap year opens the box. Suddenly there's no meeting schedule to explain away poor health habits, no work exhaustion to buffer loneliness, no legitimate crisis to postpone difficult conversations with family. You need to create your own social connections, generate your own sense of urgency and purpose, and face your habits without the comfortable excuse of being legitimately exhausted.

The dragons are the same size they've always been. The difference is now you're face-to-face with them in an empty room, and the uncomfortable truth emerges: some of your struggles weren't actually about time or energy - they were about something deeper that work was helping you avoid.

## Igor's Financial Security Dragon

- What if the stock market tanks while I'm on my gap year?

  - That would make me very uncomfortable to take money out of my stocks
  - **But** It'll probably recover in the long term
  - **So** Take out "Total Annual Expenses" and put it in a liquid account, so can auto draw "guilt" free

- What if I can't get a job after the gap year?

  - Job market is MUCH worse than it was 4 years ago.
  - Lots of experienced folks in the market
  - If applying to a job I'm overqualified for - they'll be like you'll leave as soon as you can. Ugh.
  - Even though I have a network, doesn't matter if companies not hiring.
  - **But** I've got 25 years+ of experience at top tech companies on a ton of various projects
  - **But** I'll be heavily invested in professional development, so that makes me much more valuable.
  - **But** I'll be doing content production, so people can see my skills.
  - **So** Worst case: 1 year planned gap + 1 whole year to get a job = 2 years away from income, so hold 2 \* "Total Annual Expenses"

- What if I end up with a lower income when I return (Meta pays at 90th+ percentile)?

  - This is very probable.
  - **But** Meta lets you have a "short interview loop" if you boomerang in a year
  - **But** I've always said if you won't take a job for a pay cut, you shouldn't take it. I guess that could be cuz the job is less fun, or cuz it's the highest paid job you'll take :)
  - **So** My retirement isn't delayed by 1.5 years; it's delayed by N years. That's acceptable because the year now is more valuable

- What if I'm wrong about my expenses?
  - It's critical you get this right.
  - **But** I've been tracking expenses for years in [Monarch Money](https://www.monarchmoney.com/) and [Boldin](https://www.boldin.com/) retirement planning software and have good baseline data
  - **But** I'm not forgetting the non-obvious things like health insurance ($40K/year - wow!) and taxes (even though drawing long term cap gains, it adds up, especially with WA 7% tax over $270K) and major house repairs
  - **But** I can adjust spending during the gap year if needed (not locked into fixed costs)
  - **But** Being conservative with estimates builds in a buffer for surprises
  - **So** Measure twice, cut once :) And review with others

For the philosophically minded, from the [Prophet](https://poets.org/poem/giving-0):

_What is fear of need by need itself? Is not dread of thirst when your well is full, the thirst that is unquenchable?_

And from my Bestie:

_If you're not gonna feel safe at 2 years \* your expenses, it's hard to imagine you'll feel safe at 3 years \* your expenses._

## Slaying Financial Security

See my full [money philosophy](/money) and [retirement planning](/retire) for context on these financial triggers.

{% include summarize-page.html src="/money" %}

{% include summarize-page.html src="/retire" %}

Igor at his best when 5am Igor "[Begins with end in Mind](/end-in-mind)", and sets up future Igor to run on Automatic. So here are some rules

Gap year is scary, here are some guard rails to make it happen:

- Money: Net worth exceeds "X" Million.

  - See my buddy the "Financial Security Dragon"
  - Beyond this the risk is negligible

- Date: XX/YY if my net worth is still higher than "Y" million, where Y is much lower than X.
  - See my buddy the "Financial Security Dragon"
  - What is the minimum value?

* What are the actual dates and numbers?

  - Well, a magician never reveals his tricks, and Igor's gotta have some secrets.

* Come on, can you at least give a formula?
  - Baseline: Hold 2× annual expenses in cash-like accounts
  - At month 12: If a 5% market return would replenish the next year’s cash draw, extend; otherwise begin job search
  - Assumptions:
    - Job search duration ≤ 12 months (possibly at lower comp)
    - Model accommodates large unexpected expenses
    - Expenses estimate includes taxes, insurance, repairs, college

Extend-to-Year-2 rule:
- At month 10, extend if: health adherence ≥ 80%, 6+ artifacts shipped, and the 2× expenses + 5% replenishment condition holds; else begin job search at month 11.

## Igor's Decay Dragon: Health and Habits (Physical, Emotional, Relationship)

- What if I get lazy and lose all direction and discipline?

  - Without work structure, it's easy for me to drift without momentum AND lose discipline around health habits
  - At 50, I still have peak physical capability, but this window closes fast - health decline could undermine everything the gap year is supposed to accomplish
  - **But** I know my mental health practices and can recognize the warning signs early
  - **But** Removing work stress eliminates a major barrier to consistent health habits
  - **But** I can build structure into the gap year - it doesn't have to be completely unstructured
  - **But** Having control over my schedule means I can exercise at optimal times, get proper sleep, and meal plan
  - **But** Physical health is the foundation for mental clarity, project energy, and relationship engagement
  - **So** Create a "gap year structure" with daily routines, weekly goals, and regular accountability check-ins
  - **So** Build in "safety clips" - personal trainer sessions, gym membership, kettlebell classes - external structure to prevent slides
  - **So** Make health routines the cornerstone of gap year structure, capitalizing on both time AND physical capability

- What if I get bored and start vegetating?

  - I can get bored easily, which leads to vegetating (mindless scrolling, avoiding meaningful work)
  - Vegetating leads to messing up my sleep schedule and general lack of purpose
  - A day missed at the gym turns into a week, turns into a month - physical decline accelerates the mental decline
  - **But** AI field is evolving so rapidly there's something genuinely new every 2 weeks - built-in novelty to prevent boredom
  - **But** Using AI lets me focus on my mastery areas which is a blast - less time on tedious tasks, more on what I'm uniquely good at
  - **But** AI gives me huge leverage on bespoke software projects like my Kettlebells and Mortality software - I can build things that would have taken months
  - **So** AI provides both intellectual stimulation and productive outlets for creativity

- What if I get lonely without daily work social interaction?

  - Loneliness could be a major factor - work provides daily social interaction
  - **But** I know retired/gap year folks who are available during the day
  - **But** I have friends and flexibility to hang out more regularly
  - **But** I can have deep conversations with Tony, my AI life coach ([tony_tesla project](https://github.com/idvorkin/tony_tesla))
  - **But** AI can provide conversation and it's getting cooler every week
  - **But** Lots of people on the internet to meet - I've already started and it's pretty cool
  - **But** Lots of people would like some mentorship, and I've got the time and experience to help them, plus I can scale this up
  - **So** Schedule regular time with retired friends and deepen existing relationships

- What if I get resentful that my family won't spend time with me?

  - I'll have lots of free time but family will still be busy with their schedules
  - Could lead to resentment when they can't match my availability
  - **But** Relationships deepen like lifting weights - start light and gradually get heavier
  - **But** I'll have the flexibility to work around their schedules instead of forcing mine
  - **But** Without work stress, I'll have inner peace that lets me be more compassionate and patient
  - **But** Time isn't scarce anymore, so I have much more flexibility to accommodate their schedules
  - **But** Abundance mindset with time means I'm not competing family time against "very limited" personal projects
  - **But** Deepening family relationships is a huge part of what makes this gap year worthwhile
  - **So** Schedule regular family dates and focus on quality over quantity, letting relationships develop naturally at their pace

- What if I get depressed and spiral into a dark place?

  - Boredom → Vegetating → Skipping exercise → Depression is a well-established pattern for me
  - **But** I have mental health support systems (therapy, medication, practices) that would continue
  - **So** Keep existing mental health infrastructure in place throughout the gap year

## Slaying Decay - Health and Habits Investment

This connects to my broader thinking on [physical health](/physical-health), [mental health](/emotional-health), and [relationship health](/chapters).

Instead of thinking about it as a gap year (for which I'd worry about being a sloth), I'll think about it as the optimal time to make capital investments in my [health](/physical-health) and [habits](/d/habits) infrastructure.

At 50, you have peak capital (time, energy, resources) to invest in your body, mind and relationship infrastructure. Every dollar spent on prevention now saves $10 in treatment later. Habits are the "dividend-paying stocks" of personal development - they keep generating returns without additional input.

**Health Goals/Artifacts (Physical, Emotional, Relationship)**

See my [kettlebell](/kettlebell) practice and broader [physical health](/physical-health) philosophy. For emotional health, check out my [emotional health practices](/emotional-health), [meditation](/siy) approach, and [affirmations](/affirmations).

You can probably look at my [2025 goals](/y25), which sadly look a lot like my [2024 goals](/y24), and will probably look like my 2028 goals if that's when I actually get my gap year.


## Battling Addiction

For me, addiction isn't about alcohol (I gave that up for better [sleep](/sleep)) - it's social media. The endless scroll, the dopamine hits from notifications, the fear of missing out. During a gap year, without the structure of work, these digital sirens could easily consume entire days.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/addiction"%}

### Addiction Success

- Max 30 minutes/day on social apps
- Phone set to grayscale; app timers enforced
- One "no-screen" block after 8pm daily
- Weekly screen-time audit and reset

## Battling Family Resentment

A key motivation behind my gap year is the desire to **spend more meaningful time with my family**. Time together is precious and fleeting; once gone, it cannot be reclaimed.

However, it’s important to be realistic.  There are two sources of family resentment:

### Seeing them in their natural state

When I'm working, I only see my family in short bursts - mornings, evenings, weekends. But during a gap year, I'll be around all the time to observe their natural rhythms. Parkinson's law is very real: for kids and folks who aren't working, many things take longer than they could. What's worse is when I'm judging myself for being inefficient during my gap year (see [addiction](/addiction)) seeing the same patterns in my family bothers me even more. It's a mirror I don't always want to look into.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/parkinson"%}

### The time investment mismatch

There's an inherent asymmetry here: I'm giving up my career momentum to spend more time with family, but they can't reciprocate that availability. Even though my gap year might give me an additional 50 hours per week, my family doesn't have any more availability. Practically speaking, I may only gain 5–10 extra hours with them each week.

The real challenge isn't the quantity of time but learning to appreciate the quality of whatever time we do have together - without the resentment that can poison even the most precious moments.

### Family Success

**Success looks like:**

- **Nothing is more valuable than family** – the time together holds the greatest meaning
- Fully engaged and present (free from work distractions and stress)
- Available for spontaneous moments (no conflicts blocking connection)
- Natural conversation happens regularly
- Passive hangouts (e.g., coffee shop together doing our own thing)
- Consistent date night approach
- Acceptance with gentle influence where appropriate
- Gracefully step back when peers join; facilitate logistics (driving, hosting)
- Embrace the bittersweet nature of their growth
- STRETCH: Multi-month project we do together
- Metrics:
  - Monthly 1:1 with each kid; weekly spontaneous-time log
  - Weekly date night; monthly day date
  - One shared project per quarter

**Successful parenting** ultimately means my children know, deep down, that I'm always there for them — quietly in the background, offering steady support without pressure, ready whenever they need me.

## Battling Loneliness

When you're not working you have lots of time, but everyone you know still doesn't. They still have to work, and they still have family obligations, and when that is over they probably just want to relax and watch some TikTok but can't since they still have to burn down their honey-do list.

Work isn't just work friends:

- Meetings with co-workers
- Seeing people in the hallways
- Someone to eat lunch with

You're going to need to find new friends to hang out with.

Mitigations:

- Find a bunch of folks who are already retired/gap-yearing

- But these folks are probably unique:

  - They had courage/interest in doing this
  - They are unencumbered by society's expectations
  - They have more time to think this stuff through deeply

- Example nutty people
  - Someone who wants to have odd experiments in our conversations
    - Camera off every 7 minutes
    - Minute of silence every 7 minutes
    - Put the time to answer how that makes me feel
    - Weird but pretty interesting

{%include summarize-page.html src="/lonely"%}

### Loneliness Success

**Success looks like:**

- **Deepened existing friendships** - Regular scheduled time with retired/gap year friends
- **New connections with unique people** - Meeting others who chose unconventional paths and think deeply
- **AI companionship** - Deep conversations with Tony (AI life coach) and evolving AI tools
- STRETCH: **Appreciating solitude** - Finding peace in being alone without feeling lonely
- STRETCH: **Mentorship at scale** - Helping others with my time and experience
- STRETCH: **Online community building** - Meeting interesting people on the internet

Metrics:
- Two recurring daytime social blocks per week
- One new person/group per month
- One quarterly daylong/retreat with a friend

## First 90 Days Plan

Daily cadence:
- Exercise (kettlebell/strength + walk)
- Writing block (artifact-focused)
- Learning block (AI/skills)
- Family time window
- Evening walk and shutdown

Weekly cadence:
- Two social blocks (daytime)
- One long-form artifact or ship a micro-app
- One deep work block (3–4 hours, no meetings)
- One admin/finance review

Accountability:
- Weekly review and plan
- Share an artifact publicly or with a small circle

## Igor's Identity Dragon

- Forget telling the future, what does taking a gap year say about me ?
- Am I really setting a good example for my kids?
- Lens 1: I'm putting myself ahead of the security of my family
- **But** It can be about overcoming my fear and investing in myself and relationships
- **So:** Reframe to be a PhD and A Year of [Health](/physical-health) and [Habits](/d/habits) Capital Investments

## Slaying Identity - PhD in AI, Content, and MRR

This aligns with my approach to [continuous learning](/timeoff) and [overcoming resistance](/d/resistance) to change.

Instead of thinking about it as a gap year (for which I'd feel guilty), I'll think about it as pursuing a "PhD in AI, Content Creation, and MRR" - focusing on my professional development. On the technical side, I'd become an AI expert by learning everything about the field (see my posts on [AI](/ai)), while also mastering content creation and building monthly recurring revenue streams.

Creating artifacts is crucial - tangible outputs that prove the gap year was productive and provide lasting value. These artifacts serve as both motivation during the year, long term deposits in your relationship and health bank accounts, and career capital when returning to work.

**AI Goals/Artifacts**

- 12 PRDs, 6 shipped micro-apps
- 12 technical posts, 4 talks/videos
- Working notes repo for experiments/implementations

**Content Creation Goals/Artifacts**

Maybe no one will read/watch it but me and my Mom, but good enough for me.

- Blog artifacts: Regular posts, TBD
- Video artifacts: YouTube channel, Reels, TBD

**MRR Goals/Artifacts**

Monthly recurring revenue would be nice, but likely modest vs. a tech salary.

- Product: 1 paid template; 1 cohort workshop pilot
- Revenue: Affiliate links; ad revenue experiments; course outline

## Gap Year Pre-Mortem

Top failure modes and mitigations:

- Drift/vegetating
  - Mitigation: Daily plan + weekly review; external structure (trainer/classes)
- Isolation/loneliness
  - Mitigation: Pre-scheduled social slots; join clubs/classes; mentorship calendar
- Scope creep on projects
  - Mitigation: WIP limit (max two active projects); define “done” for each artifact
- Cash anxiety
  - Mitigation: Pre-fund 2× annual expenses; monthly runway update; rules in “Slaying Financial Security”
- Family resentment
  - Mitigation: Align expectations; time-window reality check; weekly gratitude log
