Time is my precious resource - I have a limited number of hours in my life, and once I've used them, I never get them back. However, I can preserve my time by outsourcing activities that don't have high enough return on investment. This post reminds me to outsource by enumerating my position on outsourcing, and the things I have outsourced.

### When to outsource

- Tasks I'm bad at, and that I don't want to get good at.
- Tasks which I don't enjoy doing
- Tasks which do not have sufficient ROI.
- From 7 habits: Tasks that are urgent, yet not important tasks.

### When not to outsource

- When I enjoy the activity
- When the activity builds a skill I want in my wheel house.
- When the cost of outsourcing isn't worth it.
