System design interviews are a crucial part of the hiring process for software engineers. It's a test of an engineer's ability to design scalable, efficient, and robust systems. However, preparing for these interviews can be overwhelming. That's why we created the SHINE method - a comprehensive guide to help you ace your system design interviews.

## Chapter 1: S - System Design Fundamentals

System design interviews test an engineer's knowledge of system design fundamentals. Here are the top 5 theories you need to know:

1. Scalability: The ability of a system to handle an increasing amount of work or users without impacting performance. It's essential to consider scalability when designing a system as it ensures that a system can handle future growth.

2. Availability: The ability of a system to remain operational even in the face of failures. Availability is achieved through redundancy and fault-tolerance mechanisms.

3. Reliability: The ability of a system to consistently perform as expected. Reliability is achieved through proper design, testing, and monitoring.

4. Performance: The speed at which a system responds to user requests. Performance is essential as users expect fast response times.

5. Security: The protection of a system from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. Security is a critical aspect of system design, and it's important to consider it at every stage of the design process.

Here are the top 5 takeaways from this chapter:

1. Always consider scalability, availability, reliability, performance, and security when designing a system.

2. Understand the trade-offs between these factors and how they impact the design of a system.

3. Use proven design patterns and best practices to design systems.

4. Test and monitor the system to ensure it meets the requirements.

5. Document the design and keep it up to date.

Exercises:

1. Design a system for an e-commerce website that can handle millions of users and transactions per day.
2. Design a system for a ride-sharing app that can handle peak demand during rush hour.
3. Design a system for a social media platform that can handle real-time updates and millions of users.
4. Research and compare different system design patterns.
5. Participate in online coding challenges that involve system design problems.

Journaling prompts:

2. Space complexity: The amount of memory required to execute an algorithm. Space complexity is also an essential factor to consider when designing a system as it impacts the system's performance.

3. Cost: The amount of money required to build and maintain a system. Cost is a critical constraint to consider, especially for startups and small businesses.

4. Bandwidth: The amount of data that can be transferred over a network in a given time. Bandwidth is a constraint to consider, especially for systems that involve transferring large amounts of data.

5. Latency: The time it takes for a system to respond to a user request. Latency is a constraint to consider, especially for systems that involve real-time interactions.

Here are the top 5 takeaways from this chapter:

1. Always consider the constraints when designing a system.

2. Understand the trade-offs between different constraints and how they impact the design of a system.

3. Use algorithms and data structures that are optimized for the given constraints.

4. Test and optimize the system to ensure it meets the constraints.

## Chapter 3: I - Identifying the Requirements

System design interviews often involve designing systems to meet specific requirements. Here are the top 5 theories you need to know:

1. Functional requirements: The features and capabilities that a system must have to meet the user's needs. Functional requirements are critical to consider as they determine the system's purpose.

2. Non-functional requirements: The qualities that a system must have to meet the user's needs. Non-functional requirements include performance, scalability, security, and usability.

3. Stakeholders: The people or organizations that have a vested interest in the system. Stakeholders can include users, customers, investors, and regulators.

4. Use cases: The specific scenarios or situations in which the system will be used. Use cases are essential to consider as they help identify the system's requirements and constraints.

5. Constraints: The limitations or restrictions that the system must operate within. Constraints can include time, budget, resources, and technology.

Here are the top 5 takeaways from this chapter:

1. Understand the requirements of the system before designing it.

2. Identify the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.

3. Identify the stakeholders and their needs.

4. Define the use cases and scenarios in which the system will be used.

5. Consider the constraints that the system must operate within.
