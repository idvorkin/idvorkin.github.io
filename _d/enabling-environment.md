Imagine the place you do your best work. Andy Matuschak defined this, and as someone who aspires to effectiveness, I fell in love with the concept. As a techie who loves efficiency, I also set about building my own. From Andy: An enabling environment significantly expands its participantsâ€™ capacity to do things they find meaningful and important. This blog is the consumption environment for mine.

There's so much to say here. Pulling in some content from Andy:

## From Andy

- [Enabling Environment](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z492hGrHvRvJiEY9UfB4Mby)
- [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5E5QawiXCMbtNtupvxeoEX)
- [Andy's about page](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes)

## Igor's Computing Setup

- Igor's [about page](/about)
- Some of the [features](https://github.com/idvorkin/idvorkin.github.io) in the readme.
- Tons of [VIM/CLI stuff](https://github.com/idvorkin/settings)
- My general vim notes

{%include summarize-page.html src="/vim" %}

- Vim specifically for writing

{%include summarize-page.html src="/vim-for-writing" %}

At its core, is writing:

{% include summarize-page.html src="/writing" %}

## Igor's Physical Setup

- I think there are some coffee shop rituals that are part of mine.

## By Task

### Production

### Consumption

### Reflection

### Discovery

### Recall

## The rider, the elephant, and the path

{% include summarize-page.html src="/switch" %}

You'd think this is about the rider, but the elephant is super important too

### Inspire and Motivate

Mood matters, and for some reason, illustrating my blog makes me thrilled. If I'm stuck having DALL-E illustrate my blog makes me thrilled!

Check out [illustrate.py](https://github.com/idvorkin/nlp/blob/3450286482c5e62c589e46521e1bfe2b5ad0082a/illustrate.py?plain=1#L24)

## By Scope

### Individual Artifacts

Check out [think.py](https://github.com/idvorkin/nlp/blob/3450286482c5e62c589e46521e1bfe2b5ad0082a/illustrate.py?plain=1#L24)

### Entire corpus

Check out this thing on embeddings. I think the story here needs to be embeddings + rag

### Comparing Artifcats or Corpus

## Visualizations

### Word clouds

Old school, but pretty simple, perhaps do a second pass through gpt to simplify

### Comic illustrations

### Dimension Reduced Vector Embeddings

### Connected Graphs

Ala - obsidians graph view

## AI Augmentation

What I'm most excited about is how to expand this with AI. My thinking program is my first cut.

Spell check and summary/eli5/TLDR are the obvious ones, but what if we extended to reflection questions, implicit assumptions, etc....

### Critical Thinking

Running over Andy's enabling environment page ...

### Other folks work here

- A different version of think.py, from [danielmiessler](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric?tab=readme-ov-file#what-and-why) lots of much better prompts
