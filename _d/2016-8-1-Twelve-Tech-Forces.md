The digital revolution has gone through 3 changes: the copy of the industrial age, the link age, and the streaming age. This is a summary of the concepts representing the new age.

### Ages of computing

- Copy Industrial Age: Hierarchy
  - Desktops, folders, files, Memos , long batch mode (months/weeks)
- Link Age: Flat web of links
  - Browser, Web, hyperlinking, Emails, Search (days)
- Streaming Age: Flows of information
  - Feeds/channels, tidbits, unbundling, tags, slack/IM, (instant)

### Streaming age

- Instant more important than access
  - non-netflix movies don't exist.
  - not on kindle doesn't exist
- Nouns liquify and shift to verbs\*
  - One Note -> Work Flowy | Google Keep
  - Documents -> editing/sharing/reading/content snacking.
  - Seems deep - find others.
  - App names - Scheduly

- Streaming implies the cloud, not personal ownership.

### (TBD) Case study of flowing: Music and Music Industry.

- Playbook for other industries.

### How to add value when copies are free

- Immediacy (Realtime/On Demand Value Add)
  - Give it to you now.
  - First for online banking
  - Amazon Prime
  - Stock Quotes
  - Early Access/Betas (Kick starter)

- Personalization
  - Change the movie to have more of what I like in it.
  - Watching with Family make it 'G Rated'
  - Some time to talk with the author. (Kick starter)

- Interpretation (Consulting/Coaching)
  - Software is free, but I show you how to use it.
  - Consulting business model.
  - Red hat, MS consulting services.
  - Squash coach

- Authenticity (Status, Moral Value, Risk Reduction)
  - Some people really value that for brand status.
  - Important if risk possible - like stolen software tampered with.
  - IPhone and Jail Breaking.
  - Software on the internet.

- Accessibility (Storage provider Value add)
  - Physical assets as a service (Uber)
  - Production tool as a service (Creative Cloud)
  - My owned content as a service (Flickr)
  - I could own the copy, but storage provide value add.
  - Digital books can be copied, but Amazon Kindle stores my highlights. Gives me flash cards.
  - My photo provide - Google Photos/Flickr

- Embodiment (The physical experience/scarcity value add)
  - People really value this - music concerts/live theatre/physical book
  - Book free, but generic author talk.
  - Holding a book.

- Patronage (I'm part of the process value add - Kick Starter)
  - Fans want to support.
  - 4 conditions: Easy; Reasonable Amount; Clear Benefit; Money goes to creator

- Discoverability (Help me find it/recommendation system):
  - Crowd sourcing (amazon/netflix rating)
  - Big compute/Deep Learning (Page Rank)
  - Trusted Curators
  - Tribes
- Notice how many of these values are kick-start rewards.
- Igor's to file
  - Trust
  - Service plans/insurance

### Old models for adding value

- Distribution
- Artificial Scarcity
- Limited Distribution (copy right/suing)

### Fixity vs Fluidity of industrial age goods (E.g. book)

- The old fixed way:
  - Fixed Content
  - Fixed Presentation
  - Fixed Container (Durable)
  - Complete

- The new way:
  - Fluid Content - If I've read previous book, skip previous book summaries.
  - Fluid PresentationLook - best for phones vs desktop
  - Fluid Container - Put it on any device/screen I have.
  - Fluid Completion - Always updated to be accurate, auto updating graphs.

### Evolution From Fixed to Flowing

- Fixed / Rare - Only makable by artisan/expert
- Free / Ubiquitous - Cheap perfect copies
- Flowing/ Sharing - Break product into parts. Share Remix. Platform.
- Open / End user Creation - Cheap tools, Audience is creator.

### Becoming

- Technology is now a service, and self upgrading.
- You'll always be a newbie, since software is self updating, and changing quickly.
- Life span most phone apps is 30 days - everything is displaced before you can figure it out.
- Today's problems caused by yesterday's success - so pain causes a a steady accumulation of small benefits.
- Protopyia - (Process and Progress): Every day is a bit better than yesterday, and really adds up.
- When making new tech, always start by cloning old tech - web sites clones of desktop apps. Office clone of 'physical office'
- Original idea of web -> TV, but with infinite channels.
  - This model is blocked by who can afford to create so much content?
  - Magic - people create their own content - WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT?
- Modern system:
  - Users do most of the work - craigs list, e-bay, youtube, facebook - platforms facilitate but create no content.
  - Amazon's big value is reviews.
- Content Manufacturing
  - High value content is NOT created by commercial entities (or classic commercial entities)
- Web in 2050, not a better web, no more then Web 2.0 is a better TV.
- WEB TODAY:
  - What can be searched on google.
  - File searchable via hyperlink - BUT - So many things not linkable.
- WEB FUTURE:
  - More digital content - specific facebook messages
  - Image search, blue pails in my photo
  - Physical world - keys in my room
  - Time - Last year - with models, predict into future.
- Web becomes conversational interface (as opposed to a place)
  - Went from cyber space -> ubiquitous assistant -> electricity.

### Cognifying - It's better then AI.

    * It's better with AI

### Flowing - From noun to verb

- Copyable products are the most valuable products - and that's a good thing.
- Old 'solids' are being malleable (??)
  - Durable goods as a Service/On Demand
    - Cars - Lyft/Uber
    - Vacations - Air BNB
    - Lodging -
    - Grocery Delivery - Dash buttons, amazon fresh
    - Shopping - Amazon
    - Telphone - slightly different
    - Software - always a service constantly upgrading.
  - On Demand

### Screening - Reading 2.0

### People of the word, the book, and screen

- The Word - Ancient Times
  - Copy Tech: Human Memory
  - Top Skills: memorization, recitation and rhetoric
  - Audience Valued: Reverence for the past, ambiguous, ornate and subjective.
  - Truth: The thing you remember (likely the best story)
- The Book - Uptil we got screens
  - Copy Tech: Cheap mass copies of words on paper
  - Top Skills: Precision (ink on paper), Linear Logic (sentences), objectivity (printed fact), authority (fixed in a book).
  - Societal Impacts - 50K - 1M english words. Culture of experts. Roots are the written document (lawg
  - Truth: What is written down by the authority.
  - Solve problems by applying laws ( Process)

- The screen
  - Copy Tech: Cheap Dynamic copies of everything on screens
  - Top Skills:
  - Audience Valued: Attention Grabbing, Concise
  - Truth: What we assemble in real time from scanning
  - Solve problems by applying technology ( code solutions )

### People of the screen

- Make their own content, and their own truth
- Fast - constant 30 second snippets, liquid - like a walk through wikipedia
- Not about words - but about pictures/videos/infographics
- WORDS are replaced by the power of coded tools + user generated content. [ Power here, but not yet grocked ]

### Will screens make us stupid?

- Argument started in the 50s saying TVs will make illiterate,
  - For short time, no one read, and reading scores were way down.
  - but NOW, more people write than ever before.
  - People 3x as much now since the 80s

### Screening (Reading 2.0)

- In theory, we're still reading, but now it's much more dynamic.
  - Video augmented, interactive (words on images), hyperlinks.
  - Books we watch + television we read

### Case Study Books:

- Start with books, then libraries of books, videos, games, education, all.
-

### Accessing - From Ownership to Just in Time Rental
