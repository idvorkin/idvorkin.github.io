## PART I: STRATEGY - The Why and What of Energy Management

### Strategic Understanding of Your Life and Energy

Before diving into energy management techniques, we need to step back and think strategically. What does it mean to be strategic about your life and energy?

{% include summarize-page.html src="/strategy" %}

Just as in business, personal energy strategy is about making trade-offs. You can't do everything, be everywhere, or please everyone. Strategic energy management means deciding what NOT to do as much as what to do.

I find it helpful to distinguish between strategy and execution: **Strategy is how it works when you get there. Execution is how you go about doing it.** In energy management, strategy is your overall approach to energy allocation, while execution is the daily habits and systems that implement that approach.

Equally important is the concept of **strategic fit** - ensuring alignment between your energy strategy and your unique circumstances. Strategic fit means creating a system where your activities, habits, and recovery practices reinforce rather than undermine each other. It's about making consistent trade-offs that leverage your strengths and account for your limitations.

The core questions I ask myself:

1. What activities generate the most value and energy in my life?
2. What activities drain my energy without proportional returns?
3. How can I structure my life to maximize the former and minimize the latter?
4. How well do my choices fit together as a coherent system?

This strategic lens helps me make better decisions about how I spend my limited energy. Without this clarity, it's easy to fall into the trap of being "busy" rather than productive and fulfilled.

### Understanding Your Personal Energy Patterns

A critical step in energy management is understanding your unique energy patterns. We all have different chronotypes, recovery needs, and energy triggers. What works for someone else might not work for you.

I've spent years observing and documenting my energy patterns:

When am I naturally most alert? For me, it's early morning, 5-9am.
What activities consistently drain me? Extended social interactions, back-to-back meetings, and administrative tasks.
What activities energize me? Creative work, teaching, physical exercise, and deep conversations.
How quickly do I recover from energy expenditure? I need about 1 day of recovery for every 3 days of intense work.
What are my early warning signs of energy depletion? Irritability, difficulty focusing, and loss of creativity.

This self-knowledge didn't come overnight. I've kept energy journals, experimented with different schedules, and paid attention to how I feel after various activities. The insights gained have been invaluable in designing my ideal day and week.

Understanding your personal energy patterns is like having an owner's manual for your body and mind. Without this knowledge, you're flying blind, trying to apply generic productivity advice that may not align with your natural rhythms.

### It's Not About Time, It's About Energy

When people ask me how I have time for all my activities - tech job, family, magic, writing, side projects - they're asking the wrong question. We all have the same 24 hours. The difference isn't time management; it's energy management.

Time is fixed and linear. Energy is dynamic and renewable. Some activities drain your energy, while others actually generate more. Understanding this distinction changed everything for me.

### Energy as Investment Portfolio

Most people operate with a flawed mental model: they start the day with a full tank of energy and gradually deplete it until they're running on fumes. But energy doesn't work that way.

Energy is more like a renewable resource that can be replenished, multiplied, and even created through strategic activities. This is why some days you can work for 12 hours and feel energized, while other days you can barely focus for 2 hours before feeling exhausted.

{% include summarize-page.html src="/energy" %}

Just like financial debt, energy debt compounds over time. When you consistently operate at an energy deficit, you accumulate "interest" in the form of decreased productivity, impaired decision-making, and eventually burnout.

I'm vigilant about avoiding energy debt through consistent sleep schedules, saying no to energy-draining commitments, and building in regular recovery periods. When I do accumulate energy debt (through travel, intense work periods, etc.), I prioritize repayment before taking on new commitments.

## PART II: EXECUTION - The How of Energy Management

### Tactical Energy Generation

I've identified several activities that reliably generate more energy than they consume:

Morning exercise: While it requires activation energy to get started, it provides a net energy gain that powers my morning.
Deep work on meaningful projects: Contrary to popular belief, focused work on challenging problems often leaves me more energized than when I started.
Teaching and sharing knowledge: Whether it's mentoring colleagues or performing magic, teaching energizes me.
Strategic breaks: Short, intentional breaks (not mindless scrolling) between focused work sessions recharge my mental batteries.

I schedule these energy-generating activities strategically throughout my day to maintain high energy levels.

### Tactical Energy Conservation

Just as important as knowing what gives you energy is recognizing what drains it:

Mindless scrolling: Social media and news feeds are designed to be addictive but leave you feeling depleted.
Unnecessary meetings: Meetings without clear agendas or outcomes are energy sinkholes.
Context switching: Rapidly jumping between different types of tasks depletes cognitive resources.
Decision fatigue: Making too many decisions, especially trivial ones, drains willpower and energy.

I'm ruthless about minimizing these energy drains in my life.

### Systems and Habits

Not all hours are created equal. I've mapped my natural energy patterns and align my activities accordingly:

Morning (peak mental energy): Deep thinking, writing, and creative work
Midday (moderate energy): Meetings, collaboration, and teaching
Afternoon (lower energy): Administrative tasks, email, and planning
Evening (variable energy): Family time, reading, and occasional creative bursts

This alignment ensures I'm using my best energy for my most important work, rather than wasting peak mental hours on low-value tasks.

Habits are energy-efficient. Once established, they require minimal willpower to maintain. I've built habits around my most important activities so they happen automatically:

Morning workout
Daily writing
Weekly planning
Regular sleep schedule

By turning these activities into habits, I free up mental energy for other tasks that require more conscious effort.

{% include summarize-page.html src="/habits" %}

### Overcoming Resistance

Starting a task often requires more energy than maintaining it. This is why procrastination is so common - the activation energy required to begin feels overwhelming.

I use several strategies to overcome this barrier:

The 5-minute rule: Commit to just 5 minutes of a task - momentum usually takes over
Environment design: Set up your space to reduce friction for important activities
Implementation intentions: Plan exactly when and where you'll do something
Habit stacking: Link new habits to established ones to reduce the activation energy required

{% include summarize-page.html src="/activation" %}

I'm ruthless about eliminating activities, people, and environments that drain my energy:

Digital distractions: Notifications are disabled, social media is time-boxed
Decision fatigue: I standardize recurring decisions (meals, clothes, routines)
Toxic relationships: I limit exposure to chronically negative people
Perfectionism: I embrace "good enough" for most things, saving perfectionism for what truly matters

By eliminating these energy drains, I conserve energy for what matters most.

{% include summarize-page.html src="/resistance" %}

### Recovery Protocols

Sustainable high energy requires oscillation between expenditure and recovery. I've learned that passive rest (like watching TV) often doesn't restore energy effectively. Instead, I focus on active recovery:

Nature exposure: Even short walks outside are remarkably restorative
Meditation: Daily practice increases focus and reduces energy waste through distraction
Deep social connection: Quality time with loved ones recharges emotional energy
Play and creativity: Non-goal-oriented creative activities replenish cognitive resources

These recovery protocols prevent temporary energy dips from becoming chronic energy deficits.

### Putting It All Together: My Energy Management Framework

TBD once I have the content better.

What about you? Have you noticed patterns in your own energy levels? What activities drain you, and which ones leave you feeling energized? I'd love to hear your experiences in the comments.
