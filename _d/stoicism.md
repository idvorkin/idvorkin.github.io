Stoicism is a philosophy of personal ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world. It was founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC.

## Core Concepts

- **Locus of Control**: Distinguishing between what we can control (our actions, thoughts) and what we cannot (external events, others' opinions).
- **Amor Fati**: "Love of fate" - accepting and embracing whatever happens.
- **Memento Mori**: Remembering that we will die, which brings clarity to what is important.
