I like saying "I have a mitzvah" - it sounds way more fun than "I have an obligation." A mitzvah is a commandment, a good deed, a blessing all rolled into one. And lucky for us, Judaism comes with exactly **613 of them**.

Think of this as your complete Jewish to-do list, handed down at Mount Sinai. Some are practical (don't murder), some are mystical (attach a mezuzah to your doorpost), and some haven't been possible since the Temple was destroyed (about those animal sacrifices...).

**Inspired by**: A.J. Jacobs' hilarious memoir [The Year of Living Biblically](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0743291484), where he attempted to follow all 613 commandments literally for a year. Spoiler: it involved a lot of creative interpretations and some very awkward social situations.

## The Big Picture

**248 Positive Commandments** - Things you should do (one for each bone/organ in the body, according to tradition)

**365 Negative Commandments** - Things you shouldn't do (one for each day of the year)

**Total: 613** - Your comprehensive guide to living Jewishly

Many of these only applied when the Temple stood in Jerusalem (destroyed in 70 CE), some only apply to priests, some only in the Land of Israel, and some only to men or only to women. But they're all part of the traditional count.

**Note**: This list follows Maimonides' enumeration with some modern annotations. Some mitzvahs only apply when the Temple stands, or only to specific groups (priests, men, women, land-owners in Israel, etc.). Traditional sources vary slightly in how they count and categorize the 613.

Now go forth and have a mitzvah! Or 613 of them.
