It's time for our annual thanksgiving 2023 trip to Oregon!

To get the most out of my time off, I'm going to follow my best practice of pre-writing what I want to get done, and adjust it as I go. This is a combination of [time off](/time-off), and all the stuff for [happiness](/happy), which I guess gets tangled up with half of my evergreen notes.

Humorously, I can just copy much of my todo from last year as it's pretty similar!

## My top priorities

### Back to generating artificats

- Bang out a daily blog post
- Write 4 family journal entries (!!)
- Finish my talk on AI

### Health and Habits

- Take care of my back
  - Coming in with a back injury so need to keep the weights light
- Meditation
  - Get back on the train. Do the full 30 minute sessions
- Half Lotus
  - 3 x 5 minute sit / side
- Diet
  - My diet has been a mess
