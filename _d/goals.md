Goals are critical, there are multiple goal systems and they have consequences. They are mechanisms to deliver without micro management.

## Why goals

Answer what, why, and how do we know there.

For a deep dive into goal execution, see [4 Disciplines of Execution](/4dx).

### Goals vs Systems

We don't rise to the level of our goals, we fall to the level of our systems. The value of goals is to help us to build and assess our systems.

### Mission, Vision, Tenets, Goals

### What vs How

## Goal Measurement

### Input vs Output Metrics

Input metrics (also known as leading indicators) measure the actions and efforts you put in, while output metrics (also known as lagging indicators) measure the results you achieve. Both have their place in goal setting:

**Output Metrics**

- Measure the actual results and impact
- Examples: Revenue generated, customer satisfaction score, project completion
- Advantages:
  - Directly tied to business value
  - Clear indication of success
- Disadvantages:
  - Often lag indicators
  - May be influenced by factors outside your control
  - Can encourage short-term thinking

**Input Metrics**

- Measure the activities and efforts that lead to results
- Examples: Sales calls made, features shipped, training hours completed
- Advantages:
  - Leading indicators
  - More directly controllable
  - Help build good habits and systems
- Disadvantages:
  - Don't guarantee results
  - Can encourage "busy work" without impact

{% include alert.html content="The best goal systems often combine both input and output metrics. Use output metrics to define success, and input metrics to track progress and adjust course along the way." %}

### Examples

**Intent: Team Productivity**

- Output metrics:
  - Features shipped per quarter
  - Customer-reported bugs
  - System uptime
- Input metrics:
  - Weekly planning sessions completed
  - Code review turnaround time
  - Technical debt cleanup hours

**Intent: Weight Loss**

- Output metrics:
  - Weight on scale
  - Body fat percentage
  - Waist measurement
- Input metrics:
  - Daily calorie tracking completed
  - Weekly meal prep sessions
  - Exercise minutes per week
  - Hours of sleep per night

**Intent: Improving Partner Relationships**

- Output metrics:
  - Partner satisfaction score
  - Number of conflicts per month
  - Quality time spent together
- Input metrics:
  - Weekly date nights completed
  - Daily appreciation expressions
  - Active listening practice sessions
  - Shared activity participation

**Intent: Personal Development**
See Mortality Software for a comprehensive approach to personal goals:

The key is matching your input metrics to activities that will drive your desired outputs. This combination ensures you're both doing the right activities (input) and achieving the desired results (output).

## Goal Systems

### SMART Goals

- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable
- Relevant
- Time Bound

### OKR (Objectives and Key Results)

- Objective
- Key Results
  - Time bound is implicit in the OKR time range.

Philosophical Difference

[Example OKRs](https://www.whatmatters.com/get-examples)

### Measuring goals

You have to decide if metrics should be used for visibility vs for evaluation and sticks.

If goals are used for compensation, become very conservative.

Results in extrinsic, not intrinsic motivation.

#### Extrinsic vs Intrinsic Motivations

#### Transparent Goals

## Common Pitfalls

### Metrics Anti-Patterns

- Measuring what is easy vs what is important
  - Looking for keys under street light - but keys are over there, why looking here? Cuz that's where we have light
- Using a metric to flog instead of to learn
  - Sev's are bad, people won't create SEVs, will use alternate systems
- Measuring a proxy, not intent
  - Goal, get rid of foxes. Solution, 5\$ per fox paid; People started breeding foxes to put them down.

### Wrong KPIs

- For a library - Count books vs Customer Engagement

## Organizational Context

### Culture vs Strategy

- Culture lets you make decisions quickly and correctly

### Process and Power

- Process shifts power from the individual in the moment, to the collective understanding of the organization.
- This shifts from maximizing upside to minimizing downside
- Sounds negative, but imagine it for a nuclear missile rocketeer. Isn't it great we ensure they the organization's will is resolved. That they have double launch keys, etc
