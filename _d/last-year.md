Bad news, you've got a last year on earth. Good news, if you're lucky you'll accept that "grand father dies, father dies, son dies" is the best blessing you can have (imagine a different ordering). If you're luckier, you'll have age appropriate health right up till that last year, or even better that last few months. If you're even luckier you'll have the strength to do what you want in your personal "centenarian Olympics".

This post draws heavily from Peter Attia's work on longevity and healthspan, particularly his book Outlive, which explores how to live better and longer through the concept of the Centenarian Olympics.

## Centarian Olympics

Compressed Morbidity. Ideally you'll stay healthy till the very end. What does that mean when you're a 100? It means you have the strength to do the functional things you'd like. So what should we call this set of activities? How about the [Centenarian Olympics](https://peterattiamd.com/how-to-train-for-the-centenarian-olympics/), containing the following activities:

- Lift my 4 year old grand kid
- Go for a 1 hour walk
- Get off the ground with 1 hand (otherwise can't play on the floor)
- Carry 2 grocery bags

This is a great idea from Peter Attia. Those things sound awfully easy you think, except:

### The Inverted Parabola of Health

Regardless of your training, your health will be parabolic, initially your training will make your health positive, then it will be neutral and then it will decline. Once you're on the downward curve, it'll look like the following:

$$ Health(YearsPastPeak) = HealthAtPeak - \sum\_{n=PeakYear}^{PeakYear+YearsPastPeak} HealthDecline(n)$$

Your body decline is inevitable, you can control 2 things. 1/ Your starting health, 2/ Your rate of decline.

### Your peak health age

You want to train as hard as you can till you peak. The better your starting position the more room you have for the inevitable decline.

### Your rate of decline

You can't stop your decline but you can slow it down. Same as the plan to build your starting health

## The Four Horsemen of Death

While the Centenarian Olympics give us functional goals to strive for, we must understand what we're training against. Peter Attia describes four major threats to our longevity and health span - the Four Horsemen of Death:

1. **Cardiovascular Disease** - Heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular issues remain the leading cause of death. Prevention involves maintaining healthy blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and cardiovascular fitness.

2. **Cancer** - The second leading cause of death, with prevention focusing on early detection, lifestyle factors, and maintaining a strong immune system.

3. **Neurodegenerative Disease** - Including Alzheimer's and dementia, these conditions severely impact quality of life. Prevention involves cognitive engagement, physical exercise, and metabolic health.

4. **Accidents** - While less predictable, we can reduce risk through maintaining physical capability (strength, balance, coordination) and cognitive function.

These horsemen don't just threaten our life - they threaten our ability to compete in our personal Centenarian Olympics. Our training isn't just about being able to lift our grandkids or walk for an hour â€“ it's about building resilience against these major threats:

- **Cardiovascular Training** (Zone 2 and Zone 5) helps fight the first horseman by maintaining heart health and vascular function
- **Strength Training** helps fight cancer through improved metabolic health and helps prevent accidents through better functional capacity
- **Stability Work** reduces accident risk and supports brain health through complex movement patterns
- **Cognitive Training** combined with physical activity helps ward off neurodegenerative disease

## Physical Health Components

### Stability

### Strength

### Aerobic (Zone 2)

### Anaerobic (Zone 5)

## Spirtual Health

Read a great book about a guy who found out he was gonna die in 100 days. Smart guy used to be CEO of KPMG, cool to see what he did. Book is [Chasing Daylight](https://www.amazon.com/B09BBHVKLR). Hi stop advice, what ever you plan to do before you die, move it up.
