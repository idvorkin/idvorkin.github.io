When Meta announced they'd start charging $15 a day for parking, my first thought was: "Are you kidding me? Fifteen dollars a DAY?" I couldn't believe they were suddenly gouging us employees for something that had been free for years. The math was infuriating - that's $75 a week, $300 a month, nearly $4,000 a year just to park my damn car at work!

Wait a second you ask - "I thought you said you hated driving and rode 3000 miles a year since you biked to work everyday?" Ah, well not exactly. See, since I got the [Tesla](/tesla), it drives me, and so my armada of bicycles has been relegated to the garage of forgotten hobbies.

But, this $15 a day was a great excuse, I can restart my passion of biking to work. But then I thought, hey wait a second, why bike commute? I could totally Kayak commute!

### The way!

It's about 3 miles through Lake Union, with a few block hike on each side of the water. While if I was in good shape it would probably take an hour, I'm not in good kayak shape so it's taken me up to 90 minutes. Ugh.

I can close the last few blocks with a lime scooter, which is wonderful!

Humorously my bike ride is actually 2 miles longer.

### Where Do I Leave my Kayak

I'm not sure why it surprises me, but this is one of the first questions I get. Luckily, Meta thought of that:

### My Gear

After much trial and error, here's where I'm at

#### The Essentials

- **The boat**: [Sea Eagle EZ-Lite 10](https://buyersguide.paddlingmag.com/brand/sea-eagle/product/46-33-ezlite-10)
  - Ultra-lightweight at just 26 lbs
  - Fully drop stitch so pretty rigid
  - Low to the water gunnels so minimal wind cocking
  - No removable floor so less mess to clean up
- **The Pump**: [USB-C Rechargeable Battery powered pump](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3WW6HCB)
- **The Paddle**: [4 piece Manta Ray paddle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHKVVNW7)
  - Get Versalock => Adjustable Length
  - Get 4 piece => Way easier to fit in the car
  - Decide Manta vs Sting Ray: One is for power, one is for endurance
  - If you get 4 piece reach out and you can get paddle ends for both Sting Ray and Manta Ray
- **The Life Jacket**: [NRS Chinook](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZYWZK24)
- **The Bilge Pump**: [Seattle Sports Paddler's Bilge Pump](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0020KAZIK)

#### Misc

- Waterproof fanny pack
- Super soaker up towels
- **Waterproof dry bags** – Protecting work clothes, laptop, and personal items
- **Secure storage solutions** – Everything stays in place during the paddle
- **Phone rigging equipment**

### My other Kayaks

- **[Sea Eagle FastTrack 385](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QVN067W)** - Two person, pontoon sides, super stable but because it has a removable floor it's a bit of a PITA to setup.

### Other Kayaks

- **Advanced Elements - With Covers**
  - Cover needs to dry, I don't like it
- **Advanced Elements - AirVolution**
  - Promising, but really bad wind cocking
  - Haven't tried AirVolution Pro
- **Sea Eagle Razor Lite**
  - Kind of the big brother to the EZ Lite
  - I keep wanting to buy it because it's faster, but then I keep reading it's tippy - which sounds like not my goal
