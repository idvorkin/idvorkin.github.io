Diet dominates weight, as weight is simple arithmetic -"calories in" minus "calories out". Weight is essential because it reduces the effort required to do physical activities, and because it reduces the risk of many diseases. [Exercise, while critical to energy](/exercise), is mostly a red herring for weight loss. A great way to see this is comparing what you eat to physical Activity. A side of fries adds 500 calories to your day, but running for 30 minutes only burns 300 calories.

## My journey

Maintaining a healthy weight has always been a challenge for me. I was obese as a kid, and at multiple times my weight has crept up to 230 lbs, and with incredible diligence it had once dropped to a 150 lbs.

### Mating weight

### The bikini diet

### Juice fasting - [Fat sick and nearly dead](http://ighealth.blogspot.com/2011/08/fat-sick-and-nearly-dead.html)

### The weight pledge - [down to 149 lbs](http://ighealth.blogspot.com/search/label/weight_update)

- Tough pattern. Gorge at the start of the month, then drop hard, w/cutting
- Super hard on the transitions

### Post Corona Virus

- Nothing crazy, just low calories
- Added Hard cardio once Gym re-opened
- Staying low avoiding the in and out transitions
- Lots of porpcorn
- Only sads at work.

## Making it a habit

### Breakfast Miso

## Situational strategies

### Hotel breakfast

Family loves the free hotel breakfast (and it is a great deal), but I can't afford the calories.

Waffle guidelines:

1. Recall: I'm essentialist, and I'd rather be healthy than enjoy a free breakfast
2. Best case: Just coffee, add some milk (limit to 2)
3. Indulgent case: Waffle (I do love waffles) — only get a half waffle
