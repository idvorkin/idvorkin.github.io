Here's a thought that'll push back your retirement: Would you rather work until 65 and retire comfortably, or take a full year off at 50, return to work, and retire at 67 with less money? If you're like most people, you immediately think "that's crazy - I can't afford to lose a year's income!" But what if I told you that gap year might be the best investment you'll ever make?

We've been conditioned to think of career breaks as financial suicide, but this binary thinking misses something crucial: the compound value of time, energy, and perspective when you're still in your prime.

## The Traditional Math vs. The Real Math

**Traditional math** says: Skip a year of income at 50, lose $200K+ in salary and retirement contributions. That's a massive financial hit you'll never recover from.

**Real math** considers the full picture:

- **Health arbitrage**: Your 50-year-old body can still handle that hiking trip through Patagonia. Your 65-year-old body? Maybe not.
- **Energy arbitrage**: At 50, you have the energy to completely reinvent yourself. At 65, you're often too tired to read the novel you've been putting off.
- **Relationship arbitrage**: Your kids might still want to spend time with you at 50. At 65, they're busy with their own families.
- **Opportunity arbitrage**: A year to explore new directions at 50 could lead to a more fulfilling (and lucrative) career path.

The traditional calculation treats money as the only variable, but money without the health, energy, and relationships to enjoy it isn't wealth - it's just numbers in an account.

### The OMY Trap: How working 1 year saves you 3, or does it.

The retirement planning world has a term: **OMY** (One More Year). It's the seductive logic that keeps people working "just one more year" indefinitely.

For every extra year you work, you are 3 years closer to paying for retirement.

1. **The Income Year**: You gain one year's worth of additional income and retirement contributions. This part is real and measurable.

2. **The Mortality Year**: You move one year closer to death. Your remaining lifespan is now one year shorter. This is inevitable and non-negotiable.

3. **The Stress Year**: Work stress jokingly (but maybe not) costs you one year of life expectancy. The chronic stress, sleep deprivation, poor eating habits, lack of exercise, and constant pressure of high-performance careers take a measurable toll on your health and longevity.

**The OMY equation**: Work 1 more year = Gain 1 year of money - Lose 3 years of healthy life

This is why the gap year at 50 is so powerful - you're inverting this equation. Instead of trading your peak years for money you may not live to enjoy, you're investing in your health, relationships, and life satisfaction when you can still fully experience them.

The gap year approach acknowledges what the OMY trap ignores: **time has an expiration date, and that date is closer than you think.**

## The Energy Arbitrage

Energy is the ultimate non-renewable resource. You can't save it, invest it, or get compound returns on it. You can only spend it - and it depletes whether you use it or not.

**At 50**, you likely still have:

- Physical stamina for adventures
- Mental flexibility to learn new skills
- Emotional capacity for deep relationships
- Professional credibility to make bold moves

**At 66**, many of these are diminished or gone entirely.

Think of it this way: Would you rather have a million dollars and be confined to a wheelchair, or have $800K and be able to run marathons? The gap year is essentially this choice played out over time - you're trading some money for the peak years of your physical and mental capabilities.

## When 50-Year-Old You Meets 25-Year-Old Dreams

There's something magical that happens when your 50-year-old resources meet your 25-year-old dreams. You finally have:

- **The financial cushion** to take risks your younger self couldn't afford
- **The life experience** to avoid the mistakes that would have derailed you earlier
- **The network** to open doors that were previously locked
- **The confidence** to pursue what matters rather than what impresses others

Your gap year isn't about escaping responsibility - it's about applying decades of earned wisdom to the dreams you never had time to properly pursue.

Maybe it's:

- Writing that novel (with the life experience to make it actually good)
- Starting the business you always talked about (with the savings to survive the startup phase)
- Learning a craft (with the patience and focus that comes with maturity)
- Traveling meaningfully (with the perspective to appreciate what you're seeing)

For Igor it's probably stuff on here:

{% include summarize-page.html src="/y2024" %}

And maybe I should be making gap year goals

## The Relationship Reset

Work has a way of hijacking our relationships. We promise ourselves we'll "make more time for family when things slow down," but things never slow down. The gap year forces this reset.

**Your marriage** gets a chance to rediscover what you're like when you're not stressed, tired, and constantly checking your phone. Many couples find they've become roommates who coordinate logistics rather than partners who enjoy each other's company.

{% include alert.html content="One of the biggest risks to your financial security is a weak marriage. Avoiding a divorce saves you 50-70% of your net worth, and likely drastically improves your quality of life" style="info" %}

{% include summarize-page.html src="/partner-trouble" %}

**Your kids** see a version of you they may never have met - the one who has time for spontaneous adventures, deep conversations, and being present without mental multitasking.

**Your friendships** can move beyond occasional happy hours and status updates to meaningful shared experiences and real conversations.

The relationship investment you make during your gap year compounds for decades. Those deeper connections enrich every year that follows.

{% include summarize-page.html src="/chapters" %}

## The Career Acceleration Effect

Here's the counterintuitive part: Taking a year off often accelerates your career rather than derailing it. This happens because:

**Perspective clarity**: Distance from your current role helps you see it objectively. You might realize you've been optimizing for the wrong things or pursuing advancement in a direction that doesn't align with your strengths.

**Skill development**: Without work's urgent demands, you can focus on important skills you've been neglecting. Maybe it's technical skills, leadership development, or industry knowledge that positions you for a bigger leap when you return.

**Network expansion**: Your gap year activities connect you with people outside your work bubble. These relationships often lead to unexpected opportunities.

**Energy renewal**: You return refreshed rather than burned out. This alone can dramatically improve your performance and advancement prospects.

**Strategic positioning**: You can time your return to coincide with optimal market conditions or specific opportunities rather than just grinding through whatever's in front of you.

I've seen executives return from sabbaticals to land roles two levels above where they left. The year "off" positioned them for a leap that would have taken five years of traditional advancement.

## Making the Gap Year Financially Viable

The key is changing your savings strategy in your 40s to build "gap year capital" rather than just retirement capital.

**The traditional approach**: Save 15-20% throughout your career for a retirement starting at 65.

**The gap year approach**: Save aggressively in your 40s to fund both a year off at 50 AND retirement at 66. This might mean:

- Living below your means for 5-7 years before the gap year
- Maxing out tax-advantaged accounts earlier in your career
- Building a separate "gap year fund" that's more liquid than retirement savings
- Potentially reducing retirement lifestyle expectations slightly in exchange for the gap year experience

The math might look like:

- Years 43-49: Save 30-35% of income (instead of 20%)
- Year 50: Gap year funded from savings
- Years 51-66: Return to normal 20% savings rate
- Result: Same retirement timeline with a life-changing year in the middle

## What Actually Happens During a Gap Year

The reality of a gap year is messier and more transformative than the fantasy. Here's what typically unfolds:

**Months 1-2: Decompression**
You're probably more burned out than you realized. The first phase is often just sleeping more, reading fiction, and letting your nervous system reset. Don't rush this - it's foundational to everything that follows.

**Months 3-4: Exploration**
With your stress levels normalized, you start exploring. This might be travel, new activities, or simply having unstructured time to follow your curiosity. Many people rediscover interests they'd forgotten they had.

**Months 5-8: Deep Work**
Now you can tackle meaningful projects that require sustained focus. This is where the novel gets written, the business plan gets developed, or the new skill gets mastered. Without meetings and urgent requests fragmenting your attention, you can do work at a depth that hasn't been possible in years.

**Months 9-12: Integration**
The final phase is about figuring out how to integrate what you've learned back into a working life. This might mean negotiating different terms for your return, changing career directions, or simply having clarity about your priorities going forward.

## The Dragons: Why We Don't Take Gap Years

Despite the compelling case, most people don't take gap years. The dragons guarding this treasure are:

_In order for Igor_

**The Security Dragon**: "What if I can't find work when I return?" This fear often exceeds the actual risk.

**The Momentum Dragon**: "I can't stop now - I'm on a roll." But momentum in the wrong direction is just speed toward the wrong destination.

**The Perfectionism Dragon**: "I need to have it all figured out before I take time off." This leads to endless planning and no action.

**The Judgment Dragon**: "People will think I'm irresponsible/lazy/having a midlife crisis." Others' opinions become more important than our own well-being.

**The Identity Dragon**: "I am my job." Taking time off threatens our sense of self and social standing.

Each dragon is guarding something legitimate - security, identity, social standing are all important. But they're also holding you hostage from one of the most transformative opportunities of your life.

{% include summarize-page.html src="/resistance" %}

## The Test: How to Know If You're Ready

**Financial readiness**:

- Can you cover your gap year expenses without touching retirement savings?
- Do you have a realistic plan for returning to income-generating work?
- Are your dependents' needs secured during this period?

**Professional readiness**:

- Have you built enough reputation and network that a year away won't erase your career capital?
- Is your industry/role amenable to breaks, or do you need to create that possibility?
- Do you have clarity on how you'll position the gap year when you return?

**Personal readiness**:

- Are you taking time off TO something, not just FROM something?
- Do you have support from key relationships for this decision?
- Are you prepared for the psychological challenges of stepping away from structure and identity?

**Timing readiness**:

- Are your dependents in a phase where they can benefit from your increased presence?
- Is this a natural transition point in your career rather than an escape from problems?
- Do you have enough life experience to make good use of unstructured time?

If you can honestly answer yes to most of these, you might be one of the rare people positioned to make this unconventional choice.

## Making the Decision: A Framework for the Gap Year Choice

The gap year decision forces you to stare down the risk of the unknowns. Will you be eaten by the dragons, or will you soar through the gap? Use the decision making tools in decision making 201, but perhaps the most important question to ask: **What does this decision say about who I am?** Use these frameworks to make a choice you can stand behind, regardless of how it unfolds.

{% include summarize-page.html src="/decisive" %}

{% include summarize-page.html src="/retire" %}

The question isn't whether you can afford to take a gap year at 50. The question is whether you can afford not to.

## Is Igor Gonna take a gap year?

{% include alert.html content="I'm incredibly privileged to have both line of sight on savings and the support of my family to even consider a gap year" style="info" %}

When I started at Meta in March 2020 my plan was to take a gap year after my Meta stock cliffed in 2024. After all, I had 5 job offers include competitive offers from Google, and several mid sized companies. But today's job market is much much scarier than pre-COVID 2020 - it's become downright dicey out there. But as we say in the [7 habits](/7-habits), [begin with the end in mind](/end-in-mind)!

But to balance that, some hypothical what ifs:

- I can only see kid for N more year
- I'm only able bodied for N more years.
- I'm only alive for N more years.

So what are the dragons guarding this treasure of time?

## Igor's Financial Security Dragon

- What if the stock market tanks while I'm on my gap year?

  - That would make me very uncomfortable to take money out of my stocks
  - **But** It'll probably recover in the long term
  - **So** Take out "Total Annual Expenses" and put it in a liquid account, so can auto draw "guilt" free

- What if I can't get a job after the gap year?

  - Job market is MUCH worse than it was 4 years ago.
  - Lots of experienced folks in the market
  - If applying to a job I'm overqualified for - they'll be like you'll leave as soon as you can. Ugh.
  - Even though I have a network, doesn't matter if companies not hiring.
  - **But** I've got 25 years+ of experience at top tech companies on a ton of various projects
  - **But** I'll be heavily invested in professional development, so that makes me much more valuable.
  - **But** I'll be doing content production, so people can see my skills.
  - **So** Worst case: 1 year planned gap + 1 whole year to get a job = 2 years away from income, so hold 2 \* "Total Annual Expenses"

- What if I end up with a lower income when I return (Meta pays at 90th+ percentile)?

  - This is very probable.
  - **But** Meta lets you have a "short interview loop" if you boomerang in a year
  - **But** I've always said if you won't take a job for a pay cut, you shouldn't take it. I guess that could be cuz the job is less fun, or cuz it's the highest paid job you'll take :)
  - **So** My retirement is not delayed by 1.5 years, It's delayed by 'N' years, that's OK, the year now is much more valuable

- What if I'm wrong about my expenses?
  - It's critical you get this right.
  - **But** I've been tracking expenses for years in [Monarch Money](https://www.monarchmoney.com/) and [Boldin](https://www.boldin.com/) retirement planning software and have good baseline data
  - **But** I'm not forgetting the non-obvious things like health insurance ($40K/year - wow!) and taxes (even though drawing long term cap gains, it adds up, especially with WA 7% tax over $270K) and major house repairs
  - **But** I can adjust spending during the gap year if needed (not locked into fixed costs)
  - **But** Being conservative with estimates builds in a buffer for surprises
  - **So** Measure twice, cut once :) And review with others

## Slaying Financial Security - Gap Year Triggers

See my full [money philosophy](/money) and [retirement planning](/retire) for context on these financial triggers.

Igor at his best when 5am Igor "[Begins with end in Mind](/end-in-mind)", and sets up future Igor to run on Automatic. So here are some rules

- Money: Net worth exceeds "X" Million.

  - See my buddy the "Financial Security Dragon"
  - Beyond this the risk is negligible

- Date: XX/YY if my net worth is still higher than "Y" million, where Y is much lower than X.
  - See my buddy the "Financial Security Dragon"
  - What is the minimum value?

* What are the actual dates and numbers?
  - Well, a magician never reveals his tricks, and Igor's gotta have some secrets 🎩✨

## Igor's Decay Dragon: Health and Habits (Physical, Emotional, Relationship)

- What if I get lazy and lose all direction and discipline?

  - Without work structure, it's easy for me to drift without momentum AND lose discipline around health habits
  - At 50, I still have peak physical capability, but this window closes fast - health decline could undermine everything the gap year is supposed to accomplish
  - **But** I know my mental health practices and can recognize the warning signs early
  - **But** Removing work stress eliminates a major barrier to consistent health habits
  - **But** I can build structure into the gap year - it doesn't have to be completely unstructured
  - **But** Having control over my schedule means I can exercise at optimal times, get proper sleep, and meal plan
  - **But** Physical health is the foundation for mental clarity, project energy, and relationship engagement
  - **So** Create a "gap year structure" with daily routines, weekly goals, and regular accountability check-ins
  - **So** Build in "safety clips" - personal trainer sessions, gym membership, kettlebell classes - external structure to prevent slides
  - **So** Make health routines the cornerstone of gap year structure, capitalizing on both time AND physical capability

- What if I get bored and start vegetating?

  - I can get bored easily, which leads to vegetating (mindless scrolling, avoiding meaningful work)
  - Vegetating leads to messing up my sleep schedule and general lack of purpose
  - A day missed at the gym turns into a week, turns into a month - physical decline accelerates the mental decline
  - **But** AI field is evolving so rapidly there's something genuinely new every 2 weeks - built-in novelty to prevent boredom
  - **But** Using AI lets me focus on my mastery areas which is a blast - less time on tedious tasks, more on what I'm uniquely good at
  - **But** AI gives me huge leverage on bespoke software projects like my Kettlebells and Mortality software - I can build things that would have taken months
  - **So** AI provides both intellectual stimulation and productive outlets for creativity

- What if I get lonely without daily work social interaction?

  - Loneliness could be a major factor - work provides daily social interaction
  - **But** I know retired/gap year folks who are available during the day
  - **But** I have friends and flexibility to hang out more regularly
  - **But** I can have deep conversations with Tony, my AI life coach ([tony_tesla project](https://github.com/idvorkin/tony_tesla))
  - **But** AI can provide conversation and it's getting cooler every week
  - **But** Lots of people on the internet to meet - I've already started and it's pretty cool
  - **But** Lots of people would like some mentorship, and I've got the time and experience to help them, plus I can scale this up
  - **So** Schedule regular time with retired friends and deepen existing relationships

- What if I get resentful that my family won't spend time with me?

  - I'll have lots of free time but family will still be busy with their schedules
  - Could lead to resentment when they can't match my availability
  - **But** Relationships deepen like lifting weights - start light and gradually get heavier
  - **But** I'll have the flexibility to work around their schedules instead of forcing mine
  - **But** Without work stress, I'll have inner peace that lets me be more compassionate and patient
  - **But** Time isn't scarce anymore, so I have much more flexibility to accommodate their schedules
  - **But** Abundance mindset with time means I'm not competing family time against "very limited" personal projects
  - **But** Deepening family relationships is a huge part of what makes this gap year worthwhile
  - **So** Schedule regular family dates and focus on quality over quantity, letting relationships develop naturally at their pace

- What if I get depressed and spiral into a dark place?

  - Boredom → Vegetating → Skipping exercise → Depression is a well-established pattern for me
  - **But** I have mental health support systems (therapy, medication, practices) that would continue
  - **So** Keep existing mental health infrastructure in place throughout the gap year

## Slaying Decay - Reframe: Health and Habits Capital Investment (Physical, Emotional, Relationship)

This connects to my broader thinking on [physical health](/physical-health), [mental health](/emotional-health), and [relationship health](/chapters).

Instead of thinking about it as a gap year (for which I'd worry about being a sloth), I'll think about it as the optimal time to make capital investments in my [health](/physical-health) and [habits](/d/habits) infrastructure.

At 50, you have peak capital (time, energy, resources) to invest in your body, mind and relationship infrastructure. Every dollar spent on prevention now saves $10 in treatment later. Habits are the "dividend-paying stocks" of personal development - they keep generating returns without additional input.

**Health Goals/Artifacts (Physical, Emotional, Relationship)**

See my [kettlebell](/kettlebell) practice and broader [physical health](/physical-health) philosophy. For emotional health, check out my [emotional health practices](/emotional-health), [meditation](/siy) approach, and [affirmations](/affirmations).

You can probably look at my [2025 goals](/y25), which sadly look a lot like my [2024 goals](/y24), and will probably look like my 2028 goals if that's when I actually get my gap year.

## Igor's Identity Dragon

- Forget telling the future, what does taking a gap year say about me ?
- Am I really setting a good example for my kids?
- Lens 1: I'm putting myself ahead of the security of my family
- **But** It can be about overcoming my fear and investing in myself and relationships
- **So:** Reframe to be a PhD and A Year of [Health](/physical-health) and [Habits](/d/habits) Capital Investments

## Slaying Identity - Reframe: PhD in AI, Content Creation, and MRR

This aligns with my approach to [continuous learning](/timeoff) and [overcoming resistance](/d/resistance) to change.

Instead of thinking about it as a gap year (for which I'd feel guilty), I'll think about it as pursuing a "PhD in AI, Content Creation, and MRR" - focusing on my professional development. On the technical side, I'd become an AI expert by learning everything about the field [TODO: link to AI posts], while also mastering content creation and building monthly recurring revenue streams.

Creating artifacts is crucial - tangible outputs that prove the gap year was productive and provide lasting value. These artifacts serve as both motivation during the year, long term deposits in your relationship and health bank accounts, and career capital when returning to work.

**AI Goals/Artifacts**

- Learning artifacts: Comprehensive AI knowledge base, experiment logs, model implementations
- Several Apps written via AI, starting with PRDs
- Content artifacts: AI tutorial series, technical blog posts, open source contributions

**Content Creation Goals/Artifacts**

Maybe no one will read/watch it but me and my Mom, but good enough for me.

- Blog artifacts: Regular posts, TBD
- Video artifacts: YouTube channel, Reels, TBD

**MRR Goals/Artifacts**

Monthly recurring revenue? That would be pretty cool. Certainly I get much higher MRR at Meta, but MRR is hopefully forever due to evergreen, or mostly evergreen content.

Will this actually slay the Financial Security Dragon? Let's be real - we're talking about pocket change compared to a tech salary. But hey, a man can dream of becoming the next MrBeast of gap year content! 🎬💰

- Product artifacts: TBD
- Revenue artifacts: Affliate links? Course? Ad Revenue from Content? Who knows
