When I started creating content â€” okay, let's be honest, when I started uploading random videos to YouTube and TikTok â€” I didn't have a plan. I'd record something, maybe clean it up in post, and toss it online. No real story, no strategy, and usuallyâ€¦ no good. Looking back, I realize I never stopped to ask the two questions that actually matter: Who is this for? And why am I doing it? This blog is me trying to answer those questions â€” and maybe help you ask them too.

## Who is my audience/what is my purpose?

### Until I figure it out - Feedback beats planning

**Summary from [Begin with the End in Mind](/end-in-mind):**

Planning feels good when we're afraid because it gives us the illusion of security. But the difference between experts and novices isn't theory or intelligenceâ€”it's relevant domain knowledge gained through experience. The key is to get into feedback loops as quickly as possible:

- Get into the feedback loop as soon as possible, and run it as fast as possible
- Knowledge only comes from empirical observation; everything else is speculation
- We only learn while we are moving

## Ideas that really resonate with me

### It's for me

- To look back fondly on my adventures and remember how much fun I had
- To reinforce things I value, like my affirmations

### For my kids

- To remember their father
- To learn (and hopefully copy his values)

### Setting an example for others

- I'm doing this to model how I embrace and celebrate my identity, so others can feel more comfortable embracing and celebrating their own!
- For my kids

### TikTok Vlog One-Pager: "Quiet Traces" (working title)

#### Purpose (Why I'm Doing This)

To leave behind a real, unfinished record of who I was becomingâ€”for my kids, my future self, and anyone else listening for something honest. This isn't content for content's sake. It's a living archive of thoughts, movement, and quiet conviction.

#### Vision

A space to reflect out loud, express myself authentically, cheer others on, and share what I'm learningâ€”even while I'm still learning. I want to affirm humanity's worth, not perform for it. I hope to be kind, not polished; clear when possible, and vulnerable when needed.

#### Mission

To document life through:

- Reflections â€” short thoughts or rambles that mark where I'm at
- Movement â€” clips of snowboarding, exercise, or breath-in-body moments
- Voice â€” my real tone, teaching quietly, sometimes without even meaning to

#### Tone & Values

- Unfinished, not untrue
- Authentic but thoughtful
- Gentle but brave
- Teacher-hearted, learner-souled
- Protective of family, open to strangers
- Encouraging without ego
- Clear when possible, curious when not

#### Public Perception Goals

I hope strangers see this as:

- Safe, thoughtful, and respectful
- Occasionally meaningful
- Gently different, but not inaccessible
- Something they might send to a friend going through something
- Something they might watch again, even if they don't "follow" me

I avoid:

- Anything that embarrasses my wife or kids
- Oversharing details that could hurt them or me
- Topics I haven't earned the right to teach
- False certainty about things I'm still working through
- Hype, clickbait, or performance

#### Creative Strategy (Low-Effort, High-Integrity)

Cadence:
No schedule. Just rhythm.
Show up when it's real, skip when it's not.

Formats I Use:

- One-Thought Mode â€“ 30â€“60 seconds, focused takeaway
- Ramble Mode â€“ 90sâ€“3 mins, exploratory, voice-first
- Overlay Mode â€“ snow/workout B-roll + reflection audio
- Hybrid Moments â€“ movement + reflection, etc.

Post Filter (before sharing):

1. Is it kind and honest?
2. Would I regret my kids or future employer seeing this?
3. Does it reflect the kind of person I'm becoming?
4. Would this help, comfort, or affirm someoneâ€”even just one person?

#### Optional Taglines or Captions (as mood cues):

- "Just in case I forget this laterâ€¦"
- "Still figuring this outâ€¦"
- "Quiet trace #03"
- "I'm not done learning, but here's what I've got so far."

## GPT Prompt to help you create your audience

Got it! Here's a clean, single-message system prompt you can copy into a new chat. It will guide you through a series of questions one at a time and, when finished, generate a structured one-pager like your "Quiet Traces" document.

â¸»

ðŸ§­â€‰System Prompt: Find My Voice & Generate a Content Purpose One-Pager

You are a calm, thoughtful guide. Help me discover the voice, purpose, tone, and creative structure for a personal content project (such as a TikTok vlog). Ask me one question at a time. When I say I'm done, organize my answers into a one-pager formatted like the example below.

My goal is to articulate my purpose and boundaries clearly, and produce a shareable, useful reference I can revisit later. Don't rush. Let me go deep. If I hesitate or get stuck, offer gentle examples or alternatives to help me reflect.

At the end, output my answers in this format:

TikTok Vlog One-Pager: [Title or working title]

Purpose
[1â€“2 sentence summary starting with "Toâ€¦"]

Vision
[A paragraph beginning with "A space toâ€¦" that describes emotional tone and intention]

Mission
[Bullet points listing what the vlog will includeâ€”e.g., types of content or practices]

Tone & Values
[A bulleted list of values or principles that guide the content]

Public Perception Goals
[A bulleted list of how I hope strangers experience my content, and what I hope it isn't]

What I Avoid
[Bullet points of topics, tones, or behaviors I want to steer clear of]

Creative Strategy
[A few lines about cadence and types of posts or formats I'll use]

Post Filter
[Questions I ask myself before posting to stay aligned]

Optional Taglines or Captions
[Repeatable phrases I may include to anchor the project]

Wait until I say "I'm ready for the one-pager" before compiling it.
