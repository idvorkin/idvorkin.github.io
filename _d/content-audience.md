When I started creating content — okay, let's be honest, when I started uploading random videos to YouTube and TikTok — I didn't have a plan. I'd record something, maybe clean it up in post, and toss it online. No real story, no strategy, and usually… no good. Looking back, I realize I never stopped to ask the two questions that actually matter: Who is this for? And why am I doing it? This blog is me trying to answer those questions — and maybe help you ask them too.

## Who is my audience/what is my purpose?

### Until I figure it out - Feedback beats planning

**Summary from [Begin with the End in Mind](/end-in-mind):**

Planning feels good when we're afraid because it gives us the illusion of security. But the difference between experts and novices isn't theory or intelligence—it's relevant domain knowledge gained through experience. The key is to get into feedback loops as quickly as possible:

- Get into the feedback loop as soon as possible, and run it as fast as possible
- Knowledge only comes from empirical observation; everything else is speculation
- We only learn while we are moving

## Ideas that really resonate with me

### It's for me

- To look back fondly on my adventures and remember how much fun I had
- To reinforce things I value, like my affirmations

### For my kids

- To remember their father
- To learn (and hopefully copy his values)

### Setting an example for others

- I'm doing this to model how I embrace and celebrate my identity, so others can feel more comfortable embracing and celebrating their own!
- For my kids

### TikTok Vlog One-Pager: "Quiet Traces" (working title)

#### Purpose (Why I'm Doing This)

To leave behind a real, unfinished record of who I was becoming—for my kids, my future self, and anyone else listening for something honest. This isn't content for content's sake. It's a living archive of thoughts, songs, movement, and quiet conviction.

#### Vision

A space to reflect out loud, worship freely, cheer others on, and speak what I'm learning—even while I'm still learning. I want to affirm humanity's worth, not perform for it. I hope to be kind, not polished; clear when possible, and vulnerable when needed.

#### Mission

To document life through:

- Reflections — short thoughts or rambles that mark where I'm at
- Worship & Singing — unpolished musical moments that anchor me in God
- Movement — clips of snowboarding, exercise, or breath-in-body moments
- Voice — my real tone, teaching quietly, sometimes without even meaning to

#### Tone & Values

- Unfinished, not untrue
- Reverent but human
- Gentle but brave
- Teacher-hearted, learner-souled
- Protective of family, open to strangers
- Encouraging without ego
- Clear when possible, curious when not

#### Public Perception Goals

I hope strangers see this as:

- Safe, thoughtful, and respectful
- Occasionally meaningful
- Gently different, but not inaccessible
- Something they might send to a friend going through something
- Something they might watch again, even if they don't "follow" me

I avoid:

- Anything that embarrasses my wife or kids
- Oversharing details that could hurt them or me
- Topics I haven't earned the right to teach
- False certainty about things I'm still working through
- Hype, clickbait, or performance

#### Creative Strategy (Low-Effort, High-Integrity)

Cadence:
No schedule. Just rhythm.
Show up when it's real, skip when it's not.

Formats I Use:

- One-Thought Mode – 30–60 seconds, focused takeaway
- Ramble Mode – 90s–3 mins, exploratory, voice-first
- Overlay Mode – snow/workout B-roll + reflection audio
- Unpolished Worship – clips of singing or voice practice, as-is
- Hybrid Moments – song + thought, movement + prayer, etc.

Post Filter (before sharing):

1. Is it kind and honest?
2. Would I regret my kids or future employer seeing this?
3. Does it reflect the kind of man I'm becoming?
4. Would this help, comfort, or affirm someone—even just one person?

#### Optional Taglines or Captions (as mood cues):

- "Just in case I forget this later…"
- "Still figuring this out…"
- "Quiet trace #03"
- "I'm not done learning, but here's what I've got so far."

## GPT Prompt to help you create your audience

Got it! Here’s a clean, single-message system prompt you can copy into a new chat. It will guide you through a series of questions one at a time and, when finished, generate a structured one-pager like your “Quiet Traces” document.

⸻

🧭 System Prompt: Find My Voice & Generate a Content Purpose One-Pager

You are a calm, thoughtful guide. Help me discover the voice, purpose, tone, and creative structure for a personal content project (such as a TikTok vlog). Ask me one question at a time. When I say I’m done, organize my answers into a one-pager formatted like the example below.

My goal is to articulate my purpose and boundaries clearly, and produce a shareable, useful reference I can revisit later. Don’t rush. Let me go deep. If I hesitate or get stuck, offer gentle examples or alternatives to help me reflect.

At the end, output my answers in this format:

TikTok Vlog One-Pager: [Title or working title]

Purpose
[1–2 sentence summary starting with “To…”]

Vision
[A paragraph beginning with “A space to…” that describes emotional tone and intention]

Mission
[Bullet points listing what the vlog will include—e.g., types of content or practices]

Tone & Values
[A bulleted list of values or principles that guide the content]

Public Perception Goals
[A bulleted list of how I hope strangers experience my content, and what I hope it isn’t]

What I Avoid
[Bullet points of topics, tones, or behaviors I want to steer clear of]

Creative Strategy
[A few lines about cadence and types of posts or formats I’ll use]

Post Filter
[Questions I ask myself before posting to stay aligned]

Optional Taglines or Captions
[Repeatable phrases I may include to anchor the project]

Wait until I say “I’m ready for the one-pager” before compiling it.
