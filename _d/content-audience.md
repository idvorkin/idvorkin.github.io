This is my guiding document for how I approach content creation audience considerations - how I want to show up and what matters to me in this space.

## Who is my audience/what is my purpose?

### Until I figure it out - Feedback beats planning

**Summary from [Begin with the End in Mind](/end-in-mind):**

Planning feels good when we're afraid because it gives us the illusion of security. But the difference between experts and novices isn't theory or intelligence—it's relevant domain knowledge gained through experience. The key is to get into feedback loops as quickly as possible:

- Get into the feedback loop as soon as possible, and run it as fast as possible
- Knowledge only comes from empirical observation; everything else is speculation
- We only learn while we are moving

### From Ariel

And so part of what I'm doing for them is modeling how I embrace and celebrate aging, so that they can feel more comfortable embracing and celebrating their own aging.

### Purpose (Why I'm Doing This)

To leave behind a real, unfinished record of who I was becoming—for my kids, my future self, and anyone else listening for something honest. This isn't content for content's sake. It's a living archive of thoughts, songs, movement, and quiet conviction.

### Vision

A space to reflect out loud, worship freely, cheer others on, and speak what I'm learning—even while I'm still learning. I want to affirm humanity's worth, not perform for it. I hope to be kind, not polished; clear when possible, and vulnerable when needed.

### Mission

To document life through:

- Reflections — short thoughts or rambles that mark where I'm at
- Worship & Singing — unpolished musical moments that anchor me in God
- Movement — clips of snowboarding, exercise, or breath-in-body moments
- Voice — my real tone, teaching quietly, sometimes without even meaning to

### Tone & Values

- Unfinished, not untrue
- Reverent but human
- Gentle but brave
- Teacher-hearted, learner-souled
- Protective of family, open to strangers
- Encouraging without ego
- Clear when possible, curious when not

### Public Perception Goals

I hope strangers see this as:

- Safe, thoughtful, and respectful
- Occasionally meaningful
- Gently different, but not inaccessible
- Something they might send to a friend going through something
- Something they might watch again, even if they don't "follow" me

I avoid:

- Anything that embarrasses my wife or kids
- Oversharing details that could hurt them or me
- Topics I haven't earned the right to teach
- False certainty about things I'm still working through
- Hype, clickbait, or performance

### Creative Strategy (Low-Effort, High-Integrity)

Cadence:
No schedule. Just rhythm.
Show up when it's real, skip when it's not.

Formats I Use:

- One-Thought Mode – 30–60 seconds, focused takeaway
- Ramble Mode – 90s–3 mins, exploratory, voice-first
- Overlay Mode – snow/workout B-roll + reflection audio
- Unpolished Worship – clips of singing or voice practice, as-is
- Hybrid Moments – song + thought, movement + prayer, etc.

Post Filter (before sharing):

1. Is it kind and honest?
2. Would I regret my kids or future employer seeing this?
3. Does it reflect the kind of man I'm becoming?
4. Would this help, comfort, or affirm someone—even just one person?

### Optional Taglines or Captions (as mood cues):

- "Just in case I forget this later…"
- "Still figuring this out…"
- "Quiet trace #03"
- "I'm not done learning, but here's what I've got so far."
