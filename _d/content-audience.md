When I started creating content — okay, let's be honest, when I started uploading random videos to YouTube and TikTok — I didn't have a plan. I'd record something, maybe clean it up in post, and toss it online. No real story, no strategy, and usually… no good. Looking back, I realize I never stopped to ask the two questions that actually matter: Who is this for? And why am I doing it? This blog is me trying to answer those questions — and maybe help you ask them too.

## Who/What is my audience/purpose? Feedback beats planning

Even though I love [Begin with the End in Mind](/end-in-mind) - there is something to be said about "Feedback beats planning" Until I figure it out - start producing content:

Planning feels good when we're afraid because it gives us the illusion of progress/security. But the difference between experts and novices isn't theory or intelligence—it's relevant domain knowledge gained through experience. The key get feedback loops as quickly as possible:

- Get into the feedback loop as soon as possible, and run it as fast as possible because:
- Knowledge only comes from empirical observation; everything else is speculation
- We only learn while we are moving

### AI Agent Stories

Real experiences with AI agents:

## Appendix

### Quick Reminders

Final check before sharing:

1. Does this match my aspirations of being a class act?
1. Does it pass the new york times test?
1. Would I regret my kids or future employer seeing this?
1. Would this help, comfort, or affirm someone—even just one person?
