It's easy to forget the many, often tiny things that makes me happy. For when that happens, here's some reminders:

<script src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-3.0.1.min.js"></script>
<div class="alert alert-primary" id="sunburst_text">
    Click in any box or circle
</div>

<div id="sunburst">
</div>

<script type=module>
    import { defer, load_auto_sunburst } from '/assets/js/index.js'
    defer(() => load_auto_sunburst("Invest in"))
</script>

<script>
    <!-- TODO get this to work properly in blogger_import, but too much work, leave it here for now -->
function toggle_play_pause(id) {
  const player = document.getElementById(id)
  if (player.paused) {
    player.play();
  } else {
    player.pause();
  }
}
</script>

<div class= 'alert alert-warning' id="random-eulogy-role">
Wearing a silly hat, his trusty folding bike at his feet, and using a purple fountain pen, Igor "Began with the end in mind" with the "important but not urgent" task of penning this eulogy, likely starting at 5am. Igor wanted this life, so he wrote it, he reviewed it, he lived it, and he worked with his family, friends, and multitude of mentors, to adjust and tweak it.
