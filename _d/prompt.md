A prompt will kick start a great conversation, a great insight, and a great relationship. Here are lots of prompts. For fun, pick a prompt at random and ask it to someone else, or answer it yourself. However, it takes a lot of trust and vulnerability to answer these questions, so make sure the person feels very empowered to not answer a question.

    Too many choices? Pick a category and then ask the question in the blue box!

## Work Prompts

_From the [awkward 1:1](https://medium.com/@mrabkin/the-art-of-the-awkward-1-1-f4e1dcbd1c5c) and Holloway's remote management guide_

### Give extra honest feedback

- Are they acting like the best manager / report / partner you could wish for? Are you? Why or why not? Discuss.
- What have you already told someone else about this person (or heard others say)? Share with them. Discuss.
- What is everyone around neglecting to tell this person?
- What's the work equivalent of this person having food stuck in their teeth? Be a good friend / coworker and tell them.

### Receive extra honest feedback

Remember skip the fluffy answer and ask again until you get something real.

- Tell them a growth area you're working on currently. Tell them why you picked it (even if it was one of those "not-really-optional" ones!).
- Ask for advice.
- Check for your own role in a weird situation.
- Pick a thing you've recently complained about. Ask them — "What could I've done differently in that situation?" Ask for feedback on how to be better.
- Admit a fault or a mistake. Ask for support and advice. Ask them if they noticed you making it or not.

### Career Growth

- When did you recently get an opportunity to learn and grow? How can we create more of those?
- Have you seen someone else doing something you felt worked really well? What was it?
- What should I know about you that would help me support you better?
- What are you doing here that you feel is most in line with your long-term goals?
- If you could be proud of one accomplishment between now and next year, what would it be?
- Is anything holding you back from doing the best work you can do right now?
- Is there a project or area outside your current role where you feel you could be contributing?
- Which areas make you feel like your hands are tied or you are unable to reach your full potential?
- If you were to create your ideal position, how would it differ from what you are currently doing?
- At what point in the past week were you most frustrated with or discouraged by your work? What can I do to help you manage that?

### Seeking feedback

_To get some deep feedback, use the prompts in getting extra honest feedback._

Or ask the more boring questions

- Would you like more or less direction from me?
- Would you like more or less feedback on your work? If more, what additional feedback would you like?
- If you were coaching me to have a greater positive impact, what would you tell me?
- What can I tell you about myself that might make it easier to understand me and work with me?
- Have you seen a product or initiative at another company recently and thought to yourself, 'I wish we'd done that'?
- What vibrations (news, rumors, dynamics) are you picking up that you think I should know about?
- What's our biggest oversight, and how do we resolve it?
- What do you feel is our biggest risk right now?
- What was the most useful part of our conversation today?
- What are you worried about right now?

### Building relationships

- How's life?
- What's going on for you these days outside of work?
- What is something you've done that you're proud of?
- What was something you were scared of as a child? Have you overcome it?
- What fictional character do you most identify with?
- Would you rather be known or unknown? Why?
- What hot topic usually turns into an argument for you?
- Do you have a motto or personal mantra?
- What's on your bucket list?

### Transition and change questions

- Imagine it's two years from now, and things have gone well: What has been your role in that? What does your role look like?
- What are you worried might happen if you made this transition?
- What will happen if you don't take this step?
- What would need to change for you to get to a point of "let's do this" or "I don't want this"? What information do you need?

### Team dynamics

- How would you say we're doing at working together as a team? What makes you say that?
- What do you think the rest of the team is most concerned about? (People may also share what they are personally concerned about; this framing makes it easier to share.)
- Who on the team is doing really well right now? (Also listen for names that don't come up.)

### Well-being

- Are there any decisions you're hung up on?
- I've noticed you're a little quieter than usual. Is there anything you'd like to talk about?
- Do you feel stretched thin? (This wording is useful to measure subjective stress, not objective workload.)
- What, if anything, did you used to do that you find you don't have time for right now?
- What is your takeaway from this discussion? (This is especially helpful to get to action steps from a thorny issue.)
- In our last one-on-one you mentioned you were frustrated by X and wanted to try Y as a solution. How has that been going?
- During this meeting you've mentioned that you'd like to pursue X. What steps can you take toward that before our next one-on-one?
- What could we change about work that would improve the rest of your life?

### Conflict resolution

- What does your ideal outcome look like? (Could be about a specific conflict that's come up, or approached hypothetically.)
- What's hard for you in getting to that outcome?
- What do you really care about?
- What's the worst-case scenario you're worried about?

### Getting deeper

- Are you afraid of anything at work?
- I've noticed that our last several one-on-ones have stayed pretty surface. What are your honest impressions of this meeting? What could we be doing differently or better?
- What's something you used to strongly believe in that you no longer do today?
- Before making a telephone call, do you ever rehearse what you are going to say? Why?
- What are three things you and I appear to have in common?
- What do you feel most grateful for in your life?
- Take four minutes and tell me your life story in as much detail as possible.
- If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?
- Is there something that you've dreamed of doing for a long time? Why haven't you done it?
- What do you value most in a friendship?
- What, if anything, is too serious to be joked about?

### Meta & Feelings

Talk about emotions. Label one you're feeling, or what you sense from other person. Boom, instant awkward and great discussion.

- Any meta-conversation about your conversations.
- We never talk about Topic A, we just always talk Topic B. Why is that?
- When I tell you about Topic A, you always react like this, and that's why I don't tell you that stuff. When I bring up Topic B, how do you feel? Why is that?
- Ask for their fears. What are they afraid of (for their career, the project, an upcoming tough meeting)? Why? Share your own.
- Trust check. How easy is it for both of you to share intimate things with each other? Why? What would make it easier? Discuss.

### Building Self-Confidence

- What's an accomplishment at work you're proud of?
- When did you overcome a challenge you thought was too difficult?
- What strengths do others see in you that you sometimes overlook?
- How do you remind yourself of your value to the team?
- What's a recent risk you took, and what did you learn from it?
- Who is someone at work who inspires confidence, and what can you learn from them?
- How do you handle setbacks or mistakes in a way that builds resilience?

- How do you celebrate your progress, even on small goals?
- What's one thing you can do this week to step outside your comfort zone at work?

Find a time when you and your partner have at least 45 minutes free and are able to meet in person. For each set of questions, each person should answer each question, but in an alternating order, so that a different person goes first each time.

### How Was Your Day

Better than "how was your day?" - try these specific questions:

- What was the best part of your day?
- Was there anything frustrating about your day?
- Did you help anyone today?
- Did anyone help you today?
- What did you do at recess?
- What made you laugh today?

- This didn't go how I wanted, but I'll figure out what to do next
- I'm proud of you for putting in so much effort, even though it didn't work out this time

### Better Than Good Job

Instead of just saying "good job", try these prompts to build mental strength and independence:

- "You worked so hard on this—what do YOU think?" Encourage reflection and help them value their own thoughts.
- "I love how you kept trying, even when it got tough." Acknowledge persistence and teach that effort matters more than instant results.
- "Look how far you've come!" Celebrate progress and improvement, not just the end result.
- "You solved that problem in such a creative way!" Call out specific traits they used, like creativity or courage.
- "What was the hardest part, and how did you figure it out?" Build problem-solving skills and remind them of their capabilities.
- "It's okay to feel frustrated. What could you try next?" Teach that discomfort is part of learning.
- "I'm proud of how YOU feel about this." Help them find satisfaction in their own accomplishments.

- What's something you wish you could change?
- Who do you talk to when you need help?

## Mental Health

### Feeling Anxious

- "It's understandable I feel that way right now." Feeling frustrated, nervous, or sad isn't weakness—it's human.
- "What's one thing I can control right now?" Focus on taking small actions like deep breaths or clearing your desk.
- "How else can I look at this situation?" Maybe a setback is a setup for something better.
- "I don't have to do this alone." Asking for help shows courage, not weakness.
- "I'm allowed to say no." Setting boundaries protects your mental health.
- "What's the worst that could happen?" Often, it's not as bad as we imagine.
- "I don't have to have all the answers right now." It's okay to sit with uncertainty.
- "What would I say to a friend in this situation?" Be as kind to yourself as you would be to others.
- "What small step can I take right now?" Start with one tiny action to build momentum.
- "How have I gotten through hard times before?" You've overcome challenges before, and you can do it again.
