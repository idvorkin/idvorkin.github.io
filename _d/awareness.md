A transformative spiritual guide that challenges you to wake up from the sleep of unconscious living. Anthony de Mello, a Jesuit priest and psychotherapist, delivers spiritual tough love through short chapters filled with stories, parables, and direct challenges. His message: most of us spend our lives asleep, and awareness is the key to waking up to true happiness and freedom.

## Key Ideas

### "I" vs. "Me"

De Mello draws a sharp line between **"I"** (the awareness that observes) and **"me"** (the bundle of labels, roles, and identifications you carry around). "I" is never threatened -- it can't be. When someone criticizes you and you feel hurt, it's "me" that's hurt: your identity as a good parent, a competent worker, a likable person. Strip away every label -- your name, nationality, profession, beliefs, achievements -- and what remains is "I," the awareness itself. Nothing can touch it. The moment you see this, threats lose their power, because they were always aimed at "me," never at "I."

_Computing analogy: "I" is the kernel-mode supervisor -- the OS itself, always running, never threatened by any user-space crash. "Me" is a user-mode identity process: your roles, labels, and self-image running in user space. When someone insults "me," a user-mode process panics. But the kernel doesn't care -- it just observes the panic. Awareness practice is learning to operate from kernel mode instead of being trapped in user space. See the [full computing analogy](#a-computing-analogy-for-awareness) below._

### The Four Steps to Wisdom

The only structured program in the book ([Ch 25](#ch-25----four-steps-to-wisdom)):

1. **Detect the negative feeling.** You can't deal with a cancer you haven't detected. Many people are depressed, anxious, or resentful without even knowing it.
2. **The feeling is in you, not in reality.** The rain isn't negative -- you are. The pain is in your knee, not in the table you bumped. No person on earth has the power to make you unhappy.
3. **Don't identify with the feeling.** Not "I am depressed" but "depression is there." You are the sky; the feeling is a cloud passing through.
4. **Don't try to change -- just see.** Understanding is fire; it burns everything else away. When you truly see, change happens by itself.

De Mello says: do this a thousand times and you'll make the biggest discovery of your life.

### Attachment vs. Preference

You can want things without needing them. **Attachment** says "I can't be happy without this." **Preference** says "I'd like this, but I'm fine either way." The shift from attachment to preference doesn't come through willpower or renunciation -- it comes through seeing what your desire is really worth ([Ch 33](#ch-33----desire-not-preference)).

### Understanding, Not Effort

Change doesn't come from pushing harder, cultivating habits, or imitating ideals. It comes from insight -- seeing clearly what is actually going on. The car metaphor ([Ch 48](#ch-48----not-pushing-it)): you don't push the car to the next city, you turn the ignition key. The key is awareness.

## Key Practices

- **Self-observation without judgment** -- Watch everything in you and around you as if it were happening to someone else. Don't judge, don't interfere, don't fix. ([Ch 12](#ch-12----self-observation))
- **"I'd rather have happiness than have you"** -- Say this to someone you love in your mind. Notice the resistance. That's your conditioning showing. ([Ch 3](#ch-3----on-the-proper-kind-of-selfishness))
- **"I really do not need you to be happy"** -- Say this to any attachment: a person, your job, your reputation. You're making contact with truth. ([Ch 40](#ch-40----detachment))
- **"I have no right to make any demands on you"** -- Say this to someone who irritates you. Watch what happens inside. If there's resistance, you've found the dictator in you. ([Ch 28](#ch-28----change-as-greed))
- **When angry, find the fear** -- Every angry person is a frightened person. Search for what you're afraid of losing. ([Ch 20](#ch-20----fear-the-root-of-violence))
- **When unhappy, find what you added to reality** -- There's always an illusion, a demand, an expectation, a craving. ([Ch 33](#ch-33----desire-not-preference))
- **Coffin meditation** -- Imagine lying in your coffin. Look at your problems from there. Do it daily. ([Ch 55](#ch-55----dead-ahead))
- **Listen to all sounds** -- Sit quietly and hear everything around you without focusing on any one sound. Your senses come unclogged. ([Ch 53](#ch-53----listening-to-life))
- **Spend hours observing anything** -- Faces, trees, birds in flight, a pile of stones. Break out of the prison of concepts. ([Ch 36](#ch-36----getting-concrete))
- **Compare soul feelings vs. worldly feelings** -- The feeling from nature, absorbing work, real conversation vs. winning an argument or receiving applause. Notice which ones you feed on. ([Ch 56](#ch-56----the-land-of-love))

## How This Relates to Mindfulness and Search Inside Yourself

[Search Inside Yourself (SIY)](/siy) is a meditation training program for engineers developed at Google, teaching emotional intelligence through mindfulness. It provides structured, gentle practices for building self-awareness, managing emotions, and improving relationships -- think of it as practical Buddhism for the workplace. SIY emphasizes concentration practices (like following the breath) to build mental stability, then uses that stability for developing empathy, leadership skills, and resilience. It's the "how to meditate" manual with specific exercises and techniques you can practice immediately. For a broader context on mindfulness and meditation, see my [emotional health practices](/emotional-health) and [spiritual health](/spiritual-health) posts.

This book is primarily about awareness meditation -- the practice of watching everything that arises in consciousness without judgment or interference. While SIY teaches both types (with more emphasis on concentration practices like breath meditation), de Mello's "Awareness" is almost entirely focused on the awareness/insight approach. His core teaching is: just observe, don't try to change anything, and understanding will transform you naturally.

_For engineers: See [Appendix - A Computing Analogy](#a-computing-analogy-for-awareness) for a technical metaphor using threads, processes, and CPU allocation._

## Part 1: The Wake-Up Call (Ch 1-10)

The book opens like a cold bucket of water. De Mello isn't here to comfort you. He's here to tell you that you're asleep, that nobody can wake you up but yourself, and that most of what you call love and charity is dressed-up selfishness. The good news: happiness is your natural state, and you don't need to acquire anything to find it. You just need to stop being deluded.

### Ch 1 -- On Waking Up

_"Spirituality means waking up."_

- **Most people are born asleep, live asleep, marry asleep, and die asleep** without ever waking up. They never understand the loveliness of human existence.
- The Jaime story: A father knocks on his son's door. "Jaime, wake up!" "I don't want to go to school -- it's dull, the kids tease me, I hate school." Father: "Three reasons you must go. First, it's your duty. Second, you're forty-five years old. Third, you're the headmaster." **Wake up! You're too big to be asleep.**
- Most people who say they want out of kindergarten just want their broken toys mended. "Give me back my wife. Give me back my money. Give me back my reputation." They want relief, not a cure.
- **Waking up is unpleasant.** You're comfortable in bed. The wise guru won't try to wake you. "The nature of rain is the same, but it makes thorns grow in the marshes and flowers in the gardens."
- All mystics -- Catholic, Christian, non-Christian -- agree on one thing: **all is well.** Though everything is a mess, all is well. Most people never see this because they're having a nightmare.

### Ch 2 -- Will I Be of Help to You?

_"Don't expect me to be of help to anyone."_

- **Nobody can help you.** If you are helped, you did it. If you are damaged, you did it.
- The provincial superior story: A nun feels unsupported because her superior never visits. De Mello role-plays the superior praising her. She feels great. But then he reveals to the group that the "superior" actually thinks she's terrible and is planning to replace her. **She felt supported when she wasn't.** Most of what we feel, we conjure up in our heads.
- **"You are never in love with anyone. You're only in love with your prejudiced and hopeful idea of that person."** That's how you fall out of love -- your idea changes, not the person.
- You never trust anyone. You only trust your judgment about that person. So what are you complaining about?

### Ch 3 -- On the Proper Kind of Selfishness

_"I'd rather have happiness than have you."_

- De Mello's exercise: Think of someone you love and say, "I'd rather have happiness than have you." Most people feel selfish saying this. **See how we've been brainwashed?**
- Turn it around: "How could you be so selfish that you would demand I choose you above my own happiness?"
- A Jesuit cousin opened retreats with: "The test of love is sacrifice, the gauge of love is unselfishness." De Mello asks a woman: "Would you want me to love you at the cost of my happiness?" She says yes. So now **you've got two unhappy people, but long live love!**
- The real problem: we've been programmed to equate love with suffering and sacrifice, when true love flows from [happiness](/happy), not from self-destruction.

### Ch 4 -- On Wanting Happiness

_"We don't want to be unconditionally happy."_

- We say: "I'm ready to be happy provided I have this and that." Which really means: "You are my happiness. If I don't get you, I refuse to be happy."
- Spirituality -- real spirituality, not piety or devotion -- is **the most practical thing in the world.** Look at the heartache, loneliness, fear, confusion everywhere. Can you think of anything more practical than waking up?
- "What's the earthly use of putting a man on the moon when we cannot live on the earth?"
- We've been taught to place our happiness in external conditions. **The first step to waking up is seeing this conditioning for what it is.**

### Ch 5 -- Psychology vs. Spirituality

_"Nothing is more practical than spirituality."_

- De Mello is a psychologist who practices psychotherapy, and he has a great conflict: sometimes psychology and spirituality pull in opposite directions.
- **People have to suffer enough in a relationship to get disillusioned with all relationships.** Sometimes therapy just keeps people asleep by relieving pressure before they hit rock bottom.
- The Little Johnny story: Johnny's modeling with putty. Teacher: "What are you making?" "A teacher." (out of cow dung). Principal: "What are you making?" "A principal." Psychologist: "You're making a psychologist." Johnny: **"Wrong. Not enough cow dung!"**
- The poor psychologist can only relieve pressure. **Spirituality goes to the root.** Related: the distinction between relief and cure in [emotional health](/emotional-health).

### Ch 6 -- Neither Is Renunciation the Solution

_"Anytime you're practicing renunciation, you're deluded."_

- **When you renounce something, you're tied forever to the thing you renounce.** When you fight something, you give it power.
- An Indian guru says: "Every time a prostitute comes to me, she talks about God. Every time a priest comes to me, he talks about sex."
- Don't renounce it. **See through it.** Understand its true value and it will drop from your hands on its own.
- The only thing that works is understanding, not willpower, not sacrifice, not effort. If you woke up, you'd simply drop the desire for it. This connects to the Buddhist concept of letting go that runs through [spiritual health](/spiritual-health).

### Ch 7 -- Listen and Unlearn

_"Truth is never expressed in words. Truth is sighted suddenly, as a result of a certain attitude."_

- Some people get woken up by suffering. Others can wake up by **listening** -- not agreeing or disagreeing, but having an attitude of openness.
- **Learning in spirituality means unlearning** almost everything you've been taught. A willingness to unlearn.
- An 87-year-old Jesuit told de Mello: "I should have heard you speak sixty years ago. I've been wrong all my life." **That is faith** -- openness to truth no matter the consequences.
- We hate the new. Jesus was rejected not because the news was good, but because it was new. We don't want new things, particularly when they involve saying "I was wrong."
- Are you listening to confirm what you already think? Or are you listening to discover something new?

### Ch 8 -- The Masquerade of Charity

_"Charity is really self-interest masquerading under the form of altruism."_

- **Three types of selfishness:**
  1. Giving myself the pleasure of pleasing myself (obvious)
  2. Giving myself the pleasure of pleasing others (hidden, more dangerous)
  3. Doing good so I won't get a bad feeling (the worst -- acting from guilt)
- A woman volunteers at the rectory. She admits she does it for her need to be needed. De Mello: **"You're almost enlightened!"** At least she's honest. "I give something, I get something." That's not charity -- it's enlightened self-interest.
- "I was hungry, and you gave me to eat" -- and what do the righteous reply? **"When? We didn't know it."** They were unconscious of their goodness. A good is never so good as when you have no awareness that you're doing good.
- The soldier who falls on a grenade, the suicide bomber -- both act from "self-interest" in some sense. **De Mello isn't excluding selfless action, but insisting we look honestly at our motivations.**
- Worst kind: the priest who doesn't want to meet someone but says "Come on in!" because he doesn't have the guts to say no. That's not love, that's cowardice dressed as charity.

### Ch 9 -- What's on Your Mind?

_"Life is a banquet. And the tragedy is that most people are starving to death."_

- People on a raft off Brazil, perishing from thirst -- **the water they were floating on was fresh water.** The river flowed into the sea with such force it went out for miles. They had no idea. That's us: surrounded by joy, happiness, love, with no notion whatsoever.
- We've been brainwashed, hypnotized. Like a magician who makes you see what isn't there and miss what is.
- **"Repent" doesn't mean "weep for your sins." It means wake up!** Put on a new mind. Take on a new way of looking at things.
- Brainwashing test: **when someone attacks your beliefs and you react emotionally, that's a pretty good sign you've been brainwashed.** You're ready to die for an idea that was never yours.
- The second thing needed: **understand that your ideas might be wrong,** and it's these wrong ideas making your life a mess -- ideas about love, freedom, [happiness](/happy).

### Ch 10 -- Good, Bad, or Lucky

_"The only difference between Jesus and those others was that he was awake and they weren't."_

- **We differ from criminals only in what we do, not in what we are.** The Chinese farmer parable: A farmer's horse runs away. Neighbors: "Bad luck!" Farmer: "Good luck, bad luck, who knows?" Horse returns with wild horses. "Good luck!" Son breaks leg taming them. "Bad luck!" Army comes conscripting, skips the son. "Good luck!" **And so it goes -- you never know.**
- If you achieved enlightenment, you'd do so in self-interest, and you'd be lucky. What's there to glory about?
- The Pharisee wasn't evil -- **he was stupid.** He didn't stop to think. Someone once said, "I dare not stop to think, because if I did, I wouldn't know how to get started again."
- Stop feeling bad about being selfish. We're all the same. **Self-awareness about selfishness is the beginning of freedom from it.**

---

## Part 2: The Practice (Ch 11-21)

Having established that we're asleep, de Mello now teaches what awareness actually looks like in practice. Self-observation without judgment. Stripping away false identities. Understanding negative emotions. And the radical idea that happiness isn't achieved -- it happens when obstacles drop away. This section is the how-to, though de Mello would bristle at calling it that.

### Ch 11 -- Our Illusion About Others

_"If you see through yourself, you will see through everyone. Then you will love them."_

- **Drop your false ideas. See through people.** If you see through yourself, you see through everyone. Then you will love them.
- Expect the worst -- you're dealing with selfish people. That's not cynicism, that's freedom. **You'll never be disillusioned again, never disappointed, never feel rejected.**
- The tramp and the Rolls-Royce: A beautiful lady picks up a tramp, brings him to her mansion, puts him in servants' quarters. Then she remembers him, invites him to her room, to her bed. Next morning, as he's leaving, she asks "How was it?" He says: **"Oh, it was fine for the likes of me, but was it fitting for a great lady like yourself?"** Even in that situation, the conditioning shows.
- Nobody ever rejects you -- they reject what they think you are. Nobody ever accepts you either. Until people wake up, they're accepting or rejecting their image of you.

### Ch 12 -- Self-Observation

_"Watch everything in you and around you as if it were happening to someone else."_

- **Self-observation is the most important thing, and no one can help you with it.** No technique, no method -- the moment you pick up a technique, you're programmed again.
- "I'm depressed" is false. **"I am experiencing a depression right now"** is accurate. You are not your depression. Clouds come and go; you are the sky.
- **Three rules:** Don't judge. Don't interfere. Don't "fix" anything. Watch. Observe.
- "The trouble with people is that they're busy fixing things they don't even understand." Things don't need to be fixed. **They need to be understood. If you understood them, they'd change.**
- Related to the [body scan and self-awareness practices](/siy) in Search Inside Yourself, but de Mello takes a harder line: don't even try to change what you observe.

### Ch 13 -- Awareness Without Evaluating Everything

_"What you judge, you cannot understand."_

- "He's a communist" -- understanding stops. **You slapped a label on him.** How are you going to understand what you disapprove of?
- A scientist observes ants with no further end than to study them. No desire to train them or get anything out of them. **Adopt that attitude toward yourself.**
- "The day you attain a posture like that, you will experience a miracle. You will change -- effortlessly, correctly." Change happens; you don't have to bring it about.
- **Awareness needs discipline but not effort.** Like an athlete whose whole life is sports -- the discipline is natural, born from love of the thing. "The moment you get bitten by the bug of awareness -- oh, it's so delightful!"
- Socrates said the unaware life is not worth living. Most people live mechanical lives, with somebody else's thoughts and emotions.

### Ch 14 -- The Illusion of Rewards

_"Is there a life before death?"_

- Many think the most important question is "Who is Jesus Christ?" or "Does God exist?" or "Is there life after death?" Wrong. **The question is: Is there a life before death?**
- People who don't know what to do with this life are all hot and bothered about the next one. **One sign you're awakened: you don't give a damn about what's going to happen in the next life.**
- Eternal life doesn't mean everlasting (time perduring forever). **Eternal means timeless -- right now.** Eternity is right now.
- "When you hear 'Repent for your past,' realize it's a great religious distraction from waking up." Don't weep for sins committed while asleep. **Wake up!**
- Related to [death](/death) as a spiritual teacher -- when you stop worrying about what comes after, you start living what's here.

### Ch 15 -- Finding Yourself

_"You understood astronomy and black holes, but you don't know who you are?"_

- The most important question in the world: **"Who am I?"** You understood computer science but you don't know who you are? You're a sleeping scientist.
- If people knew who they were, there'd be no religious wars. Like the girl who asks a boy, "Are you a Presbyterian?" He says, **"No, we belong to another abomination!"**
- Self-observation: are you aware of your reactions right now? Are you picking up any sounds besides my voice? **If not, you're being brainwashed.**
- "Who's living in you?" Maybe your daddy is listening, not you. "I could take you apart piece by piece and ask: this thought -- does it come from Daddy, Mommy, Grandma?"
- **This "I" might be nothing but a conglomeration of past experiences, conditioning, and programming.** That's painful to see. But awakening begins with that pain.

### Ch 16 -- Stripping Down to the "I"

_"Am I my thoughts? No. Am I my body? Evidently not."_

- Exercise: Write down what you are -- businessman, priest, Catholic, alive, flexible. Now notice: there's "I" observing "me." **An interesting phenomenon that has never ceased to cause wonder.**
- The mystics are searching for the thinker behind the thoughts. Things, thoughts, thinker. **Can the knife cut itself? Can the eye see itself?**
- Am I my thoughts? They come and go. Am I my body? Every cell replaced in seven years. Am I my name? I can change it. Am I my career? My beliefs? My religion?
- **None of these are "I."** Strip them away: not my thoughts, not my emotions, not my body, not my labels. What remains?
- When you truly experience that the "I" is not any of those things, **nothing can threaten you anymore.** Because threats were always to labels you identified with, never to the "I" itself.

### Ch 17 -- Negative Feelings Toward Others

_"Anytime you have a negative feeling toward anyone, you're living in an illusion."_

- A woman at a conference shared how she got in touch with her hatred for three people, asked Jesus for help, began to cry, and the hatred dissolved. She went to them and the situation resolved itself.
- De Mello's principle: **if you have a negative feeling toward anyone, something is seriously wrong with you, not them.** The world's all right. You're the one who has to change.
- A dietitian goes into orbit when someone says "the food stinks" -- **she has identified with the food.** The "I" is never threatened; only the "me."
- But what about injustice? Shouldn't you act? **Of course you should act -- but without negative feelings you'll be much more effective.** Negative emotions blind you. "Where we had one problem, now we have two."
- Compassion that is free of negative emotion is clear-eyed, effective, and powerful. Compassion polluted by anger makes everything worse.

### Ch 18 -- On Dependence

_"Perfect love casts out fear. Where there is love there are no demands, no expectations, no dependency."_

- We depend on each other practically -- butcher, baker, candlestick maker. That's fine. **But to depend on another psychologically -- to need someone for your happiness -- that's the trap.**
- If you depend emotionally, the next step is demanding, then fear of loss, then mutual control.
- "I enjoy your company immensely, but I do not cling. **What I really enjoy is not you; it's something greater than both you and me** -- a kind of orchestra that plays one melody in your presence. But when you depart, the orchestra doesn't stop."
- "Unless you hate your father and mother... unless you renounce everything you possess, you cannot be my disciple." Not physical renunciation -- **when your illusions drop, you're in touch with reality, and you will never again be lonely.**
- Loneliness is not cured by human company. It is cured by contact with reality. Related: the difference between solitude and loneliness in [emotional health](/emotional-health).

### Ch 19 -- How Happiness Happens

_"Awareness, awareness, awareness means -- awareness."_

- **Self-observation is delightful.** After a while, as illusions crumble, you begin to know things that cannot be described. It's called happiness. You become addicted to awareness.
- The disciple asks for a word of wisdom. Master writes: "Awareness." Disciple: "Can you expand?" Master: "Awareness, awareness, awareness." Disciple: "But what does it mean?" Master: **"Awareness, awareness, awareness means -- awareness."**
- The sheep-lion story: A lion raised among sheep bleats and runs like them. A real lion drags him to a pool and says "Look!" The sheep-lion sees his reflection, **lets out a mighty roar, and is never the same again.** That's awakening.
- "I have not known a single person who gave time to being aware who didn't see a difference in a matter of weeks."
- The archer proverb (Tranxu): **"When the archer shoots for no particular prize, he has all his skills. When he shoots for a gold prize, he goes blind."** The need to win drains him of power.
- Happiness is not excitement or thrills. You can be happy in your depression. **You can be happy in your anxiety.** You observe the cloud passing through you without identifying with it.

### Ch 20 -- Fear: The Root of Violence

_"There are only two things in the world: love and fear."_

- **There's only one evil: fear. There's only one good: love.** Call it happiness, freedom, peace, joy, God -- the label doesn't matter.
- Every evil in the world traces to fear. Every angry person is a frightened person. **Think of the last time you were angry. Search for the fear behind it.** What were you afraid of losing?
- The truly nonviolent person is the fearless person. It's only when you're afraid that you become angry. Related to the roots of suffering explored in [spiritual health](/spiritual-health).

### Ch 21 -- Awareness and Contact with Reality

_"To deny the self, to die to it, is to understand its true nature."_

- Watch everything inside and outside. When something happens to you, **see it as if it were happening to someone else.** No comment, no judgment, no interference.
- St. Teresa of Avila received the grace of disidentifying from herself. If someone else has cancer, I'm not emotionally devastated. If I have an exam, that's different. **The difference is identification with "me."**
- "How would it be if God gave me grace not to call these things mine?" I'd be detached. **That's what it means to lose the self, to deny the self, to die to self.**
- This is not a metaphor. This is the core practice. Disidentify from the "me" and you're free.

## Part 3: Obstacles (Ch 22-39)

De Mello now turns to what blocks awakening: religion misused, labels we cling to, the rat race, desire versus preference, cultural conditioning, the prison of words. This is the longest section because there are so many ways we keep ourselves asleep. He tears them down one by one with stories and parables.

### Ch 22 -- Good Religion: The Antithesis of Unawareness

_"God would be much happier if you were transformed than if you worshiped."_

- Our Lady of Fatima is on a plane that starts shaking. The miraculous statue cries out: **"Our Lady of Lourdes, pray for us!"** One "Our Lady" helping another.
- A thousand pilgrims protested because the bishop named the wrong Our Lady as patroness. **That's the trouble with [religion](/religion) if you don't watch out.**
- "When worship becomes more important than love, when the Church becomes more important than life, when God becomes more important than the neighbor" -- **you've missed the point entirely.**
- An Italian wedding reception moves into the church. Everyone's having a wonderful time. The priest is furious: "They're making noise in the House of God!" His assistant: "Jesus was once present at a wedding." Priest: **"But they didn't have the Blessed Sacrament there!!!"** The Sacrament becomes more important than Jesus himself.
- De Mello's tape-recording revelation: He discovered, listening to his therapy tapes, that he was saying things he wasn't even aware of -- irritation leaking out, unconscious rejections. **"What you are aware of you are in control of; what you are not aware of is in control of you."**

### Ch 23 -- Labels

_"Don't seek the truth; just drop your opinions."_

- **Drop the labels.** The important thing is not to know who "I" is. You'll never succeed; there are no words for it. Just drop the labels.
- "I am successful" -- crazy. Success is not part of the "I." It comes and goes. **When you identify with success, you cling to it, worry about losing it, and suffer.**
- "If you're suffering, you're asleep." Suffering is a sign you're out of touch with truth. It occurs **when your illusions clash with reality.**
- Physical pain is given so you notice disease. Psychological suffering is given so you notice falsehood. Every suffering points to a place where you've confused a concept for reality.

### Ch 24 -- Obstacles to Happiness

_"What I'm about to say could be the most important minutes of your lives."_

- "It's like throwing black paint in the air -- the air remains uncontaminated." **Nothing would have the power to hurt you if you stopped identifying with labels.**
- A fifty-five-year-old businessman at a bar says, "My classmates really made it." **The idiot!** Who determines what "making it" means? This stupid society, which is busy keeping itself sick.
- **"You're a success in life when you wake up."** Having a good job, fame, money has absolutely nothing to do with happiness. Being the president of a lunatic asylum and being proud of it? That means nothing.
- People drain all their energy getting something worthless, then they're frightened and confused. **They're puppets.** Press a button and you get a reaction.

### Ch 25 -- Four Steps to Wisdom

_"No person on earth has the power to make you unhappy."_

- **Step 1: Get in touch with negative feelings.** Lots of people are depressed without knowing it. You can't deal with a cancer you haven't detected.
- **Step 2: Understand the feeling is in you, not in reality.** "I got a pretty good education. It took me years to get over it." Negative feelings are in you. Stop trying to change reality. That's crazy!
- The rain and the picnic: Who's feeling negative? The rain? Or you? When you bump your knee against a table, **the pain is in your knee, not in the table.** "Reality is not problematic. Problems exist only in the human mind."
- **Step 3: Never identify with the feeling.** It is not you. You are not lonely, you are not depressed. Loneliness is there, depression is there -- you are the awareness observing it.
- **Step 4: How do you change things? You don't!** You just see. When you see, change happens. Understanding is fire; it burns everything else away.
- Compare to [SBNRR (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)](/siy) from Search Inside Yourself -- similar principle, different packaging.

### Ch 26 -- All's Right with the World

_"The crocodile was right. This is the way the world is."_

- The crocodile story: A boy frees a crocodile from a net. The crocodile grabs him. "That's the way the world is." A bird confirms -- a snake ate her babies. A donkey confirms -- his master abandoned him. A rabbit tricks the crocodile into releasing the boy, the boy escapes -- but the boy's dog kills the rabbit. **"The crocodile was right. This is the way the world is."**
- **There is no explanation that will explain away all the suffering and evil in the world.** You'll never explain it with your formulas, religious or otherwise.
- Life is a mystery. Your thinking mind cannot make sense of it. **For that you've got to wake up, and then you'll realize: reality is not problematic. You are the problem.**
- This is not pessimism. It's radical acceptance. From that acceptance, effective action becomes possible.

### Ch 27 -- Sleepwalking

_"It is not by your actions that you will be saved, but by your being."_

- When sleeping people swing into action, **they substitute one cruelty for another.** Acting from guilt, anger, or a sense of injustice just adds more negativity.
- Meister Eckhart: "It is not by what you do, but by what you are that you will be judged."
- The dirty window metaphor: **everything looks blurred through a dirty window.** You want to change the trees and mountains outside. Wait -- examine your window first.
- "Plunge into the heat of battle and keep your heart at the lotus feet of the Lord." **You can act decisively while remaining inwardly detached.**
- The key question: Are you acting from love or from negative feelings? If the latter, you're adding more confusion to an already confused world.

### Ch 28 -- Change as Greed

_"The more you do, the worse it gets. All you have to do is understand."_

- "I have no right to make any demands on you." Say that to the person who irritates you. **Watch what happens inside.** If there's resistance, you've discovered the dictator in you.
- "I thought you were such a little lamb, didn't you? But I'm a tyrant and you're a tyrant." We all want to run other people's lives.
- An American doctor in Switzerland discovered that classmates didn't compete against each other -- **they cooperated.** He couldn't understand it. When one student heard another was failing, he offered to tutor him. That shattered the American's worldview.
- The gorilla in the zoo: Gorillas are violent in captivity but gentle in the wild. **We're all in a kind of captivity -- that's why we're violent.** When the conditions change, the violence drops.
- De Mello isn't saying don't act. He's saying **understand first, then act.** Don't let the desire for change become another form of greed.

### Ch 29 -- A Changed Person

_"I'd much rather hear you say 'I've come awake' than hear you say 'I'm sorry.'"_

- **Don't demand apologies.** "Nobody was mean to you. Somebody was mean to what he or she thought was you."
- Nobody ever rejects you. They reject their image of you. **Nobody ever accepts you either.** How devastating and how liberating.
- Compassion can be very hard. Compassion can jolt you, roll up its sleeves, operate on you. **There's no way to know what compassion looks like until you become love.**
- As you identify less with the "me," you'll be more at ease with everybody. **Because you no longer fear being hurt or need to impress anyone.** Can you imagine the relief?
- "What was the worst thing they said about you?" "They said I was a disgrace to the province." "How did you feel?" "I really felt bad." "How long did it take for the bad feeling to pass?" "About ten seconds." **That's what detachment looks like.**

### Ch 30 -- Arriving at Silence

_"Those who know, do not say; those who say, do not know."_

- **Truth cannot be put into words.** The guru can only point out your errors. When you drop errors, you will know the truth.
- Thomas Aquinas wouldn't write or talk toward the end of his life. He'd seen. **He said he'd made a fool of himself.** Everything he'd written was "so much straw" compared to what he'd experienced.
- "What does a green mango taste like?" "Sour." "Like vinegar? Like a lemon?" No -- like a mango. But you've never tasted one. **So you write a doctoral thesis on it.** And the day you finally taste it, you say: "I made a fool of myself."
- Aquinas: "About God, we cannot say what He is but rather what He is not." The highest form of knowing God is **to know God as the unknown (tamquam ignotum).** This is a canonized saint of the Catholic Church.
- St. Augustine: "If you understand, it is not God." **The moment you claim to understand God, you've grasped an idol, not God.** Related to the humility at the heart of [spiritual health](/spiritual-health).

### Ch 31 -- Losing the Rat Race

_"You're never so full of yourself as when you're in pain."_

- How do you lose the self? **Not by trying.** The harder you try, the harder it gets. You lose things when you're not trying.
- "I am Napoleon!" De Mello imagines counseling someone who believes this, going along with the delusion, then pulling the rug: **"Get off it, you're not Napoleon."** We all have our versions of this.
- St. Catherine of Siena: God said to her, "I am He who is; you are she who is not." **Have you ever experienced your is-not-ness?**
- Happiness releases you from self; suffering ties you to it. **It's false to think mortification and self-punishment lead to losing the ego.** They just make you more self-centered.
- The way to die to the self is to **understand its true nature.** When you do, it vanishes.

### Ch 32 -- Permanent Worth

_"Pleasant experiences make life delightful. Painful experiences lead to growth."_

- Where does self-worth come from? Success? Money? Attracting people? **How fragile all that is.** We define ourselves in the mirrors of other people's minds.
- "I'm beautiful because everyone says I'm beautiful." You aren't. You're neither beautiful nor ugly. Those are things that come and go. **You need to give a lot of time to reflect on this.**
- **Every negative feeling is useful for awareness.** Disappointment when things don't turn out right -- watch it! Criticism that stings -- what does that say about you?
- "Who says worry doesn't help? Every time I worry about something it doesn't happen!" And the other fellow: **"The neurotic worries about things that didn't happen in the past. Normal people worry about things that won't happen in the future."**

### Ch 33 -- Desire, Not Preference

_"When you go through life with preferences but don't let your happiness depend on any one of them, you're awake."_

- **Don't suppress desire.** That makes you lifeless. Don't renounce the objects of your desire -- understand them.
- When you see what your desire is really worth, it transforms into **preference.** A preference says: "I'd like this, but my happiness doesn't depend on it."
- The illusion that changing your exterior will change you: **"It's like imagining you change your handwriting by changing your pen."** Get a new job, a new spouse, a new guru -- nothing changes.
- "The one who would be constant in happiness must frequently change" (Confucius). **Flow.** Don't cling to a few notes in a symphony. Let the melody move.
- The key question for every desire: Is this a preference (I'm fine either way) or an attachment (I can't be happy without it)?

### Ch 34 -- Clinging to Illusion

_"When you cling, life is destroyed."_

- **Happiness is not excitement or thrills.** Thrills are like feeding a racehorse with cakes and wine. You need solid, nutritious food.
- Another illusion: someone else can do this for you. Some savior, guru, teacher. **Not even the greatest guru can take a single step for you.** "The nature of the rain is the same and yet it produces thorns in the marsh and flowers in the garden."
- Another illusion: it's important to be loved and appreciated. **We have a natural urge to love, but not to be loved.** Drop this illusion and find happiness.
- The woman at the comedy: she's roaring with laughter, completely [happy](/happy). She forgot to remind herself that nobody loves her. **In that moment of forgetting the demand to be loved, she was free.**

### Ch 35 -- Hugging Memories

_"Whom am I hugging, Tom or my memory of him?"_

- You meet a long-lost friend and give him a hug. **But you're hugging your memory, not the person.** Five minutes later you discover he's changed and you lose interest. You hugged the wrong person.
- A nun changes at a workshop. Everyone outside her community notices. But her community keeps seeing her through old eyes. **"Nothing's changed." They're the only ones who can't see it.**
- We look at people through prejudice -- prejudging. We're almost never looking at reality. **Seeing reality takes effort and alertness.**
- The Jesuit in New York who read anti-immigrant quotes to his audience -- they were shocked, until he revealed the quotes were about the Irish and Germans, not Puerto Ricans. **Same prejudice, different targets.**
- "You need understanding, not condemnation." That's how change happens -- in yourself and in others.

### Ch 36 -- Getting Concrete

_"The concept always misses something precious that is only found in reality."_

- The word "leaf" applies to every leaf on every tree. So when I say "I saw a leaf," **you really have no idea what I saw.** Concepts are universal; reality is concrete.
- **"The day you teach the child the name of the bird, the child will never see that bird again"** (Krishnamurti). Before the label, the child saw a fluffy, alive, moving thing. After the label, he sees "sparrow" -- same as every other sparrow. The uniqueness is lost.
- "What is John?" If you say he's an American, a doctor, a good person -- you've captured fragments but **you've missed the living, unique person.** The individual can be intuited but cannot be conceptualized.
- De Mello's experience: a therapist friend in the US and a woman in India -- two completely different cultures, yet the same human drama underneath. **Concepts divide; experience reveals unity.**
- This connects to the problem of [labels and identity](/emotional-health) -- we mistake our concepts for reality and then fight over the concepts.

### Ch 37 -- At a Loss for Words

_"God does not die on the day we cease to believe in a personal deity."_

- Dag Hammarskjold: **"We die on the day when our lives cease to be illumined by the steady radiance of wonder renewed daily."**
- Aquinas: "Since we cannot know what God is, but only what God is not..." The loftiest degree of knowledge of God is to know God as unknown.
- In Sanskrit: "Neti, neti" -- not that, not that. Aquinas's method: the via negativa.
- C. S. Lewis's faith crumbled when his wife died. He'd had no doubts about the afterlife until it mattered. **The rope analogy: "Would this rope bear 120 pounds?" "Yes." "We're going to let down your best friend on it." Suddenly you're not so sure.**
- "We quarrel about God's name. Let him be called by any name -- does that matter?" **We never quarrel about reality. We quarrel about opinions, concepts, judgments.**

### Ch 38 -- Cultural Conditioning

_"What is this thing called culture?"_

- "I'm an Indian." De Mello imagines being a prisoner of war, shown "his country" across the border. He's moved to tears. Then the guard says: **"Sorry, we made a mistake. We need to move up ten miles."** What was he reacting to? Nothing. A word: "India."
- Trees are not India. Trees are trees. **Frontiers exist in the human mind, drawn by stupid, avaricious politicians.**
- An American baby adopted by Russians -- it grows up loving Mother Russia, hating Americans. **The child is stamped with culture, but culture isn't identity.** You can wear it like clothes without identifying with it.
- A Jesuit friend: "Anytime I see a beggar, I must give alms. I got that from my mother." **But is that freedom, or programming?** The truly free person doesn't give because of conditioning -- she gives because she sees clearly.
- "That's why I'll never salute a flag. I abhor all national flags because they are idols." Strong words, but de Mello means it: **I salute humanity, not a flag with an army around it.**

### Ch 39 -- Filtered Reality

_"When you were young, you were programmed to unhappiness."_

- The president has advisors who filter and summarize millions of items. **The same thing happens to you** -- your conditioning, culture, and programming filter out reality before it reaches your conscious mind.
- The paranoid person is an extreme example -- always feeling threatened by things that aren't there. **But we all do a version of this.**
- "They taught us that in order to be happy you need money, success, a beautiful partner, spirituality, God. Unless you get these things, you won't be happy." **That is what I call an attachment.**
- Samuel Johnson: "The knowledge that he is to swing from a scaffold within a week wonderfully concentrates a man's mind." **Fear and desire filter out everything else.**
- We can't really be free until we see our filters. And the biggest filter of all is **attachment** -- the belief that without something specific, I cannot be happy.

---

## Part 4: Freedom (Ch 40-56)

This is where de Mello goes for the throat. Detachment. Addictive love exposed. Ego death. The sailboat metaphor. Death as liberation. And the final, devastating chapter on the land of love -- which can only be reached by passing through the pains of death to the need for persons. The book builds to a crescendo here, and the last chapter is one of the most powerful things I've ever read.

### Ch 40 -- Detachment

_"I don't need anybody's love; I just need to get in touch with reality."_

- **Attachment is a prison.** We rearrange the world to keep our attachments safe, living in constant fear of losing them.
- Exercise: Think of something you're attached to and say: **"I really do not need you to be happy. I'm only deluding myself."** If it's a person, they won't be happy to hear it -- but you'll be making contact with truth.
- Second exercise: Think of a time you were heartbroken and thought you'd never recover. What happened? Time went on. You found something else. **You didn't really need it to be happy.** That should have taught you, but we never learn.
- "I told God I don't need Him." De Mello's initial reaction: this is contrary to everything I've been taught! But then: **"I left off needing Him and discovered what he was."** Freedom from God-as-attachment led to genuine encounter with the divine.
- Not needing people doesn't mean not enjoying them. **"To depend on another human being is the only 'evil' I would attach to human relationships."** When you're free, you can love freely.

### Ch 41 -- Addictive Love

_"How can you love people when you need people? You can only use them."_

- **When I need you, I must use you.** I must manipulate you, win you, control you. I cannot let you be free.
- "I can only love people when I have emptied my life of people." In the beginning the desert feels awful and lonely. **But if you can take it, the desert begins to flower.**
- De Mello the spiritual director vs. de Mello the therapist: The therapist says "ease the suffering." The spiritual director says **"let her suffer -- she'll get sick of emotional dependence and break out of the prison."** Palliative or cure?
- When you're angry at someone and examine it: **"If you are angry, Mother, there's something wrong with you."** Stay with your anger. It's not mine. I refuse to be influenced by it.
- "Nobody does wrong in awareness." That's why theologians say Jesus could do no wrong. Not because he was trying to be good, but **because he was fully awake.** Awareness and sin are incompatible.

### Ch 42 -- More Words

_"It's not the cold outside that matters, but the thermometer."_

- Mark Twain: "It was so cold that if the thermometer had been an inch longer, we would have frozen to death." **We freeze to death on words.**
- The Finnish farmer story: Drawing the Russian-Finnish border, a farmer wants Finland. Russians ask why. **"It has always been my desire to live in Mother Russia, but at my age I wouldn't be able to survive another Russian winter."** Russia and Finland are just words -- but words trigger emotions.
- A guru calls a man "son of a bitch." The man goes livid. The guru apologizes, the man calms down. Guru: **"A few words caused a tempest. A few words calmed you down. Words, words, words."**
- We live on words rather than reality. We react to labels, not to what's actually there.

### Ch 43 -- Hidden Agendas

_"There is a difference between knowledge and awareness."_

- Information is not awareness. You can know something is bad and still do it. **Awareness means you can't do it.** That's the difference.
- A woman in a service industry asks how to maintain serenity amid ringing phones and angry people. De Mello catches the hidden attachment: **peace.** "Did it ever occur to you that you could be happy in tension?"
- "Don't make a goal out of relaxation." When you're tense, observe the tension. **Come to reality, and let the tension take care of itself.**
- "Awareness releases reality to change you." But watch out -- your ego will try to use awareness as a tool. **"I'm going to become aware so I can be happy."** That's the ego hijacking the process. Just observe.

### Ch 44 -- Giving In

_"The harder you try to change, the worse it can get."_

- **The more you resist something, the greater power you give it.** "When someone strikes you on the right cheek, offer the left." You empower the demons you fight.
- "How does one cope with darkness? Not with a broom. You turn on a light." **The more you fight darkness, the more real it becomes. The more you exhaust yourself.**
- When you renounce something, you've substituted spiritual greed for worldly greed. Before: worldly ego. After: spiritual ego. **Same ego, more refined, harder to see.**
- But if instead of renouncing the billion-dollar check, you look at it and say "Hey, this is just a scrap of paper" -- **there's nothing to fight, nothing to renounce.** Understanding dissolves the problem.

### Ch 45 -- Assorted Landmines

_"Life has no meaning -- it cannot have meaning because meaning is a formula."_

- In India, men grow up believing women are cattle. **Are they to blame?** Their glasses have been dyed a certain color. There is no salvation until they see the glasses.
- "As soon as you look at the world through an ideology, you are finished. **No reality fits an ideology.** Life is beyond that."
- Loneliness vs. aloneness: **"Loneliness is when you're missing people. Aloneness is when you're enjoying yourself."** George Bernard Shaw at a cocktail party: "It's the only thing I am enjoying here."
- Community is not formed by slaves demanding happiness from each other. **Community is formed by free people** -- emperors and princesses, not beggars. No clinging, no demands, no possessiveness.
- Some see awareness as a high point to achieve. That's making a goal of it. **With true awareness, there's nowhere to go, nothing to achieve.**

### Ch 46 -- The Death of Me

_"The only tragedy in the world is ignorance. All evil comes from that."_

- **Death is not a tragedy.** Dying is wonderful. It's only horrible to people who've never understood life. "It's only dead people who fear [death](/death)."
- "Awakening is the death of your belief in injustice and tragedy." The end of the world for a caterpillar is a butterfly for the master.
- **If you would die to the past, die to every minute, you would be the person who is fully alive.** A fully alive person is full of death -- always shedding, always being resurrected.
- Don't ask the world to change. You change first. **Until you are aware, you have no right to interfere with anyone.** When sleeping people try to change things, they substitute one cruelty for another.
- A system is about as good or as bad as the people who use it. **People with golden hearts would make any system work beautifully.**

### Ch 47 -- Insight and Understanding

_"It's not effort, not cultivating habits, not having an ideal."_

- A priest says he's lazy. Old approach: make a list, check it off, imitate your patron saint. **De Mello's approach: What do you mean by lazy?** The priest is depressed -- he failed a theology exam four years ago and never processed the disappointment. Once he works through that, the "laziness" disappears.
- **Insight, not effort.** Ideals do damage because you're focused on "what should be" instead of "what is."
- A woman afraid of dogs: instead of forcing her to pet one, de Mello helps her explore her past. At age five she was attacked by a dog, hospitalized, and nobody came to visit. **The real issue wasn't the dog -- it was the feeling of abandonment.** When she understood that, the fear dropped.
- This is the pattern: **what looks like one problem is always pointing to something deeper.** Insight finds the real issue; effort treats the surface.

### Ch 48 -- Not Pushing It

_"You need an expert, you need a mechanic to lift the hood and change the spark plug."_

- The car metaphor: Your car breaks down. Instead of getting a mechanic, you push it to the city. You push it to the next city. **"We made it." But do you call that life?** You need understanding, not pushing.
- Imitating Christ externally gets you nowhere. **"When a monkey plays a saxophone, that doesn't make him a musician."** You've got to become what Christ was.
- That's why people are so tired, so weary. **Trained to be dissatisfied with ourselves, always pushing.** But there's very little understanding.
- You don't push the car -- you turn the ignition key. The key is awareness.

### Ch 49 -- Getting Real

_"I'll learn, so it will not be said of me: 'What you said was absolutely true but totally useless.'"_

- The day after his ordination, de Mello sat in a confessional for three hours. He came out depressed -- not from what he heard, but from the realization that **his pious platitudes were no cure for cancer.** "Remember God loves you" -- what good is that against unawareness?
- He swore a mighty oath: **"I'll learn."** I won't be the priest who offers true but useless comfort.
- Awareness, insight -- as you become expert, you don't need courses in psychology. **You watch yourself, pick up negative feelings, find your own way of understanding.**
- But then you face the big villain: **self-condemnation, self-hatred, self-dissatisfaction.** These are the most insidious obstacles because they feel like virtue.

### Ch 50 -- Assorted Images

_"When a sailboat has a mighty wind in its sail, it glides so effortlessly that the boatman has nothing to do but steer."_

- **The sailboat:** When change comes through awareness, it's like wind in a sail. No pushing, no rowing. The boat glides effortlessly. That's an image of what happens when you understand.
- "It is not nature that does the injury, but the person's own heart." Paddy falls off a scaffold. "Did the fall hurt?" **"No, it was the stop that hurt."** You've got solid illusions inside you; that's where the bump hurts.
- "If the eye is unobstructed, it results in sight. If the ear is unobstructed, the result is hearing. **If the mind is unobstructed, the result is wisdom.** If the heart is unobstructed, the result is love."
- Wisdom is not experience, not applying yesterday's illusions to today's problems. **Wisdom is sensitivity to this situation, this person, uninfluenced by any carryover from the past.**

### Ch 51 -- Saying Nothing About Love

_"If you wish to love, you must learn to see again."_

- "He sent the people away and went up to the mountain to pray alone." **Has it ever occurred to you that you can only love when you are alone?**
- What does it mean to love? **To see a person, a situation, a thing as it really is** -- not as you imagine it. And to give it the response it deserves.
- What prevents us from seeing? **Our conditioning, concepts, categories, prejudices, projections, labels.** Seeing is the most arduous thing a human can undertake.
- A free person is free even in prison. "If a person makes you go one mile, go two." **You may think you've enslaved me, but you haven't.** Freedom resides in the heart, not in circumstances.

### Ch 52 -- Losing Control

_"A nice definition of an awakened person: a person who no longer marches to the drums of society."_

- As a child you were given a taste of the drug called approval. **You became addicted.** You lost your freedom. Others now have the power to make you happy or miserable.
- A. S. Neill (author of Summerhill): **"The sign of a sick child is that he is always hovering around his parents."** The healthy child forgets his mother and goes exploring. He's secure enough to look for frogs.
- We were given drugs: approval, attention, success, prestige, power. **Having tasted them, we became cravenly dependent.** We dread losing them.
- "Hell is other people," said Sartre. **When you're in dependency, being with people means constant tension.** You have to be on your best behavior, live up to expectations, never let your hair down.
- An awakened person dances to the music that springs up from within, not to the drums of society.

### Ch 53 -- Listening to Life

_"Lose your mind and come to your senses."_

- You need awareness and nourishment. **Good food, good wine, good water. Taste them.** The pleasures of the senses and the mind. A good book, a good discussion, thinking deeply.
- President Carter told Americans to be austere. De Mello: **"He shouldn't tell them to be austere. He should tell them to enjoy things."** Most people in affluent countries have lost the capacity for enjoyment.
- An animal in its natural habitat never overeats, never drinks what harms it, always exercises as much as it needs. **We've lost that.** We're lost in our minds, in go, go, go.
- "I lost my freedom in front of a plate of chocolates." But no more. **"I'm satisfied with very little and I enjoy it intensely."** When you enjoy something intensely, you need very little.
- People plan vacations for months, take pictures of places they never saw, then show you the album. **That's modern life.** Slow down. Taste. Smell. See.

### Ch 54 -- The End of Analysis

_"Information is not insight. Analysis is not awareness."_

- Imagine walking in with a Russell's viper on your arm, calmly describing it from an encyclopedia. **"Would you suggest ways to get rid of this creature?"** That's information without awareness. If you were aware of what the snake was, it would get brushed off through you.
- A priest in Chicago: "I knew alcohol was killing me. Nothing changes an alcoholic -- not even the love of his wife or kids. Then one day I was lying in a gutter. I opened my eyes and **I saw it was killing me.** I never had the desire to touch a drop after that."
- That's the difference. He had the information before. **What changed was awareness.** He saw it. Seeing, not knowing, is what transforms.
- "When you're doing it, it's a bad sign." Change that you force through willpower won't last. **When awareness changes you, you keep your softness, your openness, your flexibility.**

### Ch 55 -- Dead Ahead

_"The passport to living is to imagine yourself in your grave."_

- **Imagine you're lying in your coffin. Now look at your problems from that viewpoint.** Changes everything, doesn't it?
- "Most people don't live, you don't live. You're just keeping the body alive. That's not life."
- **"You're not living until it doesn't matter a tinker's damn to you whether you live or die."** At that point you live. If you're protecting your life, you're dead.
- Visit a graveyard. "He must have had all the problems I have, must have had sleepless nights." **Two centuries later, who cares?** We live for such a short time.
- The song: "Life is a dream. What is so real? When I think that all my striving merely teaches me to die, I die of disillusionment." **But from that disillusionment comes true life.** Related to the practice of [memento mori](/death).

### Ch 56 -- The Land of Love

_"To come to the land of love, you must pass through the pains of death."_

- **"If you wish to love, you must learn to see again. And if you wish to see, you must learn to give up your drug."** Tear away the tentacles of society. Externally everything will go on as before, but in your heart you will be free.
- Imagine: you refuse to take pleasure in a word of appreciation or rest your head on anyone's shoulder. You depend on no one emotionally. **"The birds of the air have their nests and the foxes their holes, but you will have nowhere to rest your head."** If you get there, you will know what it means to see with a vision unclouded by fear or desire.
- **To love persons means to die to the need for persons.** Only someone who has attempted this knows the terrors of the process.
- The man who invented fire: He taught a tribe, then disappeared -- not seeking gratitude. At another tribe, the priests killed him. But they mounted his portrait on the altar, placed the fire-making tools before it, and taught worship. **"The veneration went on for centuries. But there was no fire."**
- Where's the fire? Where's the love? **If worship isn't leading to love, if God isn't leading to life, of what use is religion except to create more division and fanaticism?**
- A. S. Neill on Summerhill: **"Every child has a god in him. Our attempts to mold the child will turn the god into a devil."** Children came as destructive little devils. In six months, they were happy and did no evil. His secret: "I am merely a man who refuses to guide the steps of children."
- De Mello's final program: (1) Psychological insight -- the "Aha" experience, not analysis. (2) Understanding your addictions. (3) Don't identify -- step outside yourself, observe the depression or anxiety as it passes through you. **"I" am not that feeling. The feeling is in me, not in reality.**
- Soul feelings vs. worldly feelings: The feeling you get from nature, absorbing work, open conversation -- compare that to winning an argument or receiving applause. **Feed yourself on the former. The latter is the drug.**
- **"People are asleep. Dead people running governments, dead people running big business, dead people educating others. Come alive!"**

## Appendix

### Two Types of Meditation: Concentration vs. Awareness

Before understanding the computing analogy, it's important to know that meditation has two fundamental forms:

**Concentration meditation** (Samatha):

- Focus attention on a single object (breath, mantra, visualization)
- Train the mind to stay focused, returning when it wanders
- Builds mental stability and calm
- Examples: Following the breath, body scan, focused attention practices
- **Computing analogy**: Keeping the main thread from [paging out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_paging) -- maintaining continuous focus loaded in active memory instead of getting swapped out by distractions

**Awareness meditation** (Vipassana):

- Open, non-judgmental observation of whatever arises
- Watch thoughts, emotions, sensations without trying to control them
- Develops insight into the nature of mind and reality
- Examples: Self-observation, mindful awareness, choiceless awareness
- Like being a scientist observing phenomena

### A Computing Analogy for Awareness

Think of your mind as a multi-core processor:

**Without awareness (default state):**

- **Main thread**: "You" running your life program -- working, talking, making decisions
- **Rogue background processes**: Mental noise constantly running -- worry, rumination, mental loops, anxiety
- **Resource drain**: These rogue processes eat up your cores. [Anxiety keeps problems in the foreground](/anxiety), consuming % of CPU you need for actual thinking
- **No monitoring**: You don't even know these processes are running -- you just feel tired, distracted, can't focus
- **System problem -- constant paging out**: By default, your focus keeps getting [paged out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_paging) -- swapped out of active memory by every distraction. You can't maintain continuous focus because you're constantly context-switching between rogue processes

**With awareness meditation (building the watchdog):**

- **Kernel monitor thread**: A separate process that watches everything -- "Oh, I'm anxious right now", "There's a thought about tomorrow", "Body is tense"
- **Resource allocation**: The more % of CPU you dedicate to the watchdog, the less % available for rogue noise processes
- **Not the same as concentration**:
  - **Concentration meditation** = keeping the main thread from paging out -- maintaining continuous focus loaded in active memory instead of getting swapped out by distractions
  - **Awareness meditation** = spinning up a monitoring process that observes EVERYTHING in parallel (the watchdog)

**Why this matters:**

- Rogue processes run when you're not watching -- they're automatic, conditioned responses
- The watchdog doesn't stop the processes, it just observes them
- Paradox: Observation itself often reduces their resource consumption
- You can't kill rogue processes by fighting them (that creates more processes!)
- But when the watchdog sees them clearly, they often spin down on their own

**What your cores are actually for:**

- You need to process some volume of input to feel happy -- your brain wants to be doing work
- But normally too much % of CPU is consumed by:
  - **Dumb noise**: Mental chatter, worry loops, rumination
  - **Wasteful scripts**: Repetitive thought patterns, conditioned responses, old stories
- This leaves insufficient % of CPU for actual reality
- **The problem**: Not that you're idle -- you're BUSY processing garbage
- Like an [idle loop](/idle) -- cores spinning, but on useless computation
- **With awareness**: You shut down the wasteful processes, freeing up % of CPU
- Now cores can process what's actually happening -- environment, sensory input, present moment
- **The revelation**: Your processing power FEELS GOOD when handling real input instead of garbage loops
- The sound of birds, feeling of breath, texture of this moment -- rich data that satisfies your need to process
- Mental loops about yesterday/tomorrow -- burning % of CPU on nothing, leaving you depleted

**The efficiency problem:**

- Awareness shows you how much % of CPU goes to waste
- All those cores spinning on anxiety about things that haven't happened
- All that % of CPU on resentment about things that already happened
- Meanwhile, actual reality (sights, sounds, sensations, what's happening NOW) goes unprocessed
- It's like running intensive background jobs while your main application (life) stutters

**De Mello's insight:** Most people have no watchdog thread at all. They ARE the main process, completely identified with it, unaware of the rogue processes eating their resources. Building the watchdog is waking up. Realizing you're not the main process OR the watchdog -- you're the computer itself? That's the non-duality thing I don't get yet.

**Open questions:**

- **CPU vs GPU processing**: Is there value in extending this analogy? Maybe CPU = conscious mind (serial, deliberate) and GPU = subconscious (parallel, automatic processing of tons of inputs)? How does this map to awareness vs concentration?
- How do you actually train the watchdog thread? Is it just repetition, or is there a specific technique?
- What's the optimal resource allocation between main process, watchdog, and environmental processing?
- Can you run too much watchdog and not enough main process? (Over-analyzing vs. living?)
- Is "flow state" when the main process runs efficiently with minimal rogue processes, or something else entirely?
- How does this model map to actual neuroscience? Different brain regions/networks?

### The Path to Non-Duality (Advanced Territory)

De Mello's teachings point toward **non-duality** -- a state where the illusion of separation dissolves.

**What is non-duality?**

- The recognition that there's no separation between "observer" and "observed"
- The sense of being a separate "self" is revealed as an illusion
- Instead of "I am watching my thoughts," there's just awareness and thoughts arising
- No boundary between "me" and "the world" -- just one unified experience
- The "death of me" isn't metaphorical -- it's the dissolution of the false self that creates duality

**How this relates to Awareness meditation:**

- Concentration meditation strengthens attention but maintains the "I am focusing" duality
- Awareness meditation reveals there's just awareness -- no "you" doing the observing
- When you observe without identifying, you realize you are not the observed
- Keep going: you're also not the observer -- you're the awareness itself
- The ultimate insight: no separate self exists -- just awareness experiencing itself

**Traditional paths to non-duality:**

- **Advaita Vedanta** (Hindu): "Thou art That" -- you are already the infinite awareness
- **Zen Buddhism**: Direct pointing to the nature of mind, koans, sudden awakening
- **Dzogchen** (Tibetan): Resting in natural awareness, recognizing the true nature of mind
- **Christian mysticism** (de Mello's tradition): "I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me"

**Igor's honest take: This is still gobbledygook to me.**

I can write about it because I've read the explanations. I can explain the concept: "no separate self, just awareness experiencing itself." But do I actually _get_ it? Nope. It's like someone describing the color blue to me -- I can repeat the words, but I don't have the experience.

When I meditate, there's definitely an "Igor" sitting there watching thoughts. When I'm upset, there's an "Igor" who's upset. The idea that this separate self is an illusion? Intellectually interesting. Experientially? Still waiting for that insight to land.

De Mello's book points toward this. Other teachers talk about it. Smart people say they've experienced it. But for me right now, it's pointing at something I can't quite see yet. Maybe someday it'll click. Or maybe I'll spend my whole life reading about non-duality while living firmly in duality.
