### Love verb vs noun

Love is a verb, it is something you do, even when it's hard. It's not a feeling. If it's a feeling you'll never find it. But, the verb you can always do.

### CI/CC - Circle of Influence/Circle of Concern

Very similar to the concept of anxiety being 'trying to control something', and shifting the question to how can you maximize your influence.

### Growing our CI

### Keeping Commitments - our most valuable PC
