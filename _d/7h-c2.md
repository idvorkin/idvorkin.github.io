All things are created twice, once in the design phase, and then again in the implementation phase. If you don't perform the first creation, someone else will. At the extreme, imagine your eulogy, that's the end too.

These are my insights based on the [7 habits](/7h) Chapter 2.

### All things are created twice

### By design or by default

### Rescripting yourself

### False Centers

Instead of being principle-centered, people often organize their lives around alternative centers. Each affects your security, guidance, wisdom, and power:

| Center      | The Problem                                                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spouse      | Emotional dependence, vulnerability to moods, conflict avoidance            |
| Family      | Conditional love based on family expectations, scripted by tradition        |
| Money       | Worth tied to net worth, decisions driven by profit over principles         |
| Work        | Identity from job title, workaholic tendencies, neglecting other roles      |
| Possession  | Self-worth from things, comparing with others, never enough                 |
| Pleasure    | Short-term gratification, diminishing returns, avoiding discomfort          |
| Friend      | Need for acceptance, chameleon behavior, dependent on social mirror         |
| Enemy       | Counter-dependent, reactive, giving power to the person you resent          |
| Church      | Image-consciousness, labeling others, guidance from social expectations     |
| Self        | Selfishness disguised as self-interest, limited perspective, using others   |

The principle-centered alternative: security from correct principles, guidance from conscience, wisdom from accurate maps, power from alignment.

### The Counterpoint: Don't Over-Plan

Planning is valuable, but it can become a trap.
