title: "My thoughts on Amazon"
permalink: /amazon
---

I spent 4 years working at Amazon, some things I loved, some not so much. Amazon is a huge company and the variation of behavior within a company exceeds the variation between the "median" behavior between companies. Even within the two teams I was on at Amazon I saw the exact opposite behaviors. When I talk about the good, I'll talk about the ideal good, and when I talk about the bad, I'll talk to some issues I saw that were systemically bad. As a result you'll often see me describing something as both good and bad, as it's done differently in different parts of the company.

## The Good

### Willingness to change

### Federation of startups

### The value placed on continuous improvement

### The comfort with failure

### Day 1 culture

### Embracing change

### Frugality and Resourcefulness

Frugality, done correctly is resourcefulness. It says, if you need 10 people, have 8, and you'll do better work. If you have 12 people, you'll start making up work, and bad stuff happens.

### Begin with the end in mind - Working Backwards

### Critical Thinking - Writing (and reading) Culture

[Writing is thinking](/writing)

### Business Metrics focus - QBR/MBR/WBR

### PR/FAQs

### Fulfillment and Customer Days

Mandatory for e7+, and encouraged for lower. You take a day to work in a fulfillment center or be a customer service rep. You build empathy and be amazed at the work Amazon does

Here was me during my tour, loading a truck

### Tenets

### Hiring Process

### Bar Raisers

### The Mechanism Fly Wheel

### Forte

### Connections

## Operational Excellence

### OE Meetings

### Dev Ops 101

### Severity handling

### [COEs](/coe)

### Operational Excellence vs Engineering Excellence

### Principal Engineers

### Run books

These guys did

### The rope to hang yourself

### The two pizza team

### The promo process

## The Bad

### The challenges with hyper growth - scaling people and culture

### Day 2 Culture

A thing I saw at Amazon that made me really sad, was signs on the wall describing Day 1 vs Day 2 behavior. Such signs only exist when you have a Day 2 culture :(

### A blend too junior

### The decline of the hiring bar raiser

### Pretending the subjective is objective

### The 30 page promo document

### The "style" and not "content" feedback on documents

### The ambiguity of earns trust

### The lost essence of "right a lot"

### Not enough slack

### Too much intensity

### No one knows how to use Word

### Frupidity

Frugality, done correctly is resourcefulness. It says, if you need 10 people, have 8, and you'll do better work.

Some people used frugality to focus on not the high order bit. For example, I had a frequent battle over hardware which cost less than 15\$/month.

### Not rescuing a team

### So hard to hire

## Leadership Principles (LPs): The beating heart of Amazon

At Amazon training the first thing they tell you is "Everywhere else, you see the leadership principles on the wall, and no one knows what they are", at Amazon, they are not on the walls, but instead we speak to them every day.

You don't just speak to them daily, you speak to the leadership principles multiple times a day.

### Design principles for Leadership

### The dirty secret of LPs - You can justify anything

If you think of LPs as a "vector space", you can use them to justify any behavior or action as a leadership principle.

Humorously, each LP has an opposite cancelling force.

| LP              | How to refute with an LP                                                                             |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bias for action | You are not thinking big enough. You are not customer obsessed, you need to insist on high standards |
|                 |                                                                                                      |

## LP Set: Ownership

### Ownership

### Customer Obsession

### Dive Deep

### Insist on High Standards

### Hire and Develop the best

## LP Set: Do it

### Bias for action

### Deliver Results

### Earn Trust

### Have backbone, disagree and commit

### Vocally self-critical

## The curious

### Building twice is faster than building once

### Social Cohesion is bad

### Sounds like good intentions

### Work hard have fun change the world

## My Experience at Amazon

### My time at Amazon

I care deeply about the teams I work with, and [my goodbye mail says it well](https://github.com/idvorkin/blob/blob/master/career/idvorkin_amazon_going_away_mail.pdf).

### What I wanted to learn at Amazon

- Learn the business of software (business owner)
- Operational Excellence, like [COEs](/coe)
- [Business Writing](/writing)
- [Design](/td/design)
- [Cloud first applications and SOA](/td/cloud-first-applications)
- [Data Systems](/td/data-systems)

[Manager Skills](/the-manager-book):

_Managing is hard. Lessons are hard-earned and should be cherished. This post is designed to make explicit, and improve behaviors and practices. It reminds us how to behave, and encourages continuous improvement._

As a new manager at Amazon, my top priorities:

- Hiring
- Growing my people
- Defining Success Qualitatively and Quantitatively.
- Setting the vision for the team

### Bonus learnings at Amazon

- Hiring!!
- How much ownership a college hire can take
- How much autonomy I can have
- How quickly you can build the impossible.
- Better ways for hiring, firing (Pivot), surveys (Connections), and feedback (Forte)

### Live Video

Funny stories:

- Deadline for first live stream, based on pregnant woman
- Red carpet event couldn't get cameras working - 3 tries to get our first stream out, got it right on take 3.

### Video Shopping

- The video that made me realize we need moderation
- Launching and manual moderation watching all the videos ourselves

### Charity Giving: Toys for Tots
