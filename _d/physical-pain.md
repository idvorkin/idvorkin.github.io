Physical pain is a universal experience, yet it remains one of the least understood aspects of human health. Whether it's a stubbed toe or chronic back pain, understanding the nature of physical pain can empower us to manage it effectively and improve our quality of life.

### Greak books for most injuries

### The downside

### Physio Therapy

Physio therapy is a great model for improvement. You go, they coach you, and then you have to do the work.

Critical because Practice makes permanent. See

{%include summarize-page.html src="/new-skills"%}

#### Putting up a tonne of effort to climb the wrong laddaer

#### The source of pain is rarely the place you need to fix it.

#### Massage, Stretch, Strengthen

Massage (aka Release) feels amazing, stretching good, and Strengthening Does Nothing.
Inconvenially, masssage only last 20 minutes, stretching a day or 2, but strengthing lasts for ever.

#### Self Release: Massage and Foam Roller, Tennis Ball

- Foam roller and Tennis ball are mostly self massage, which is mostly less effective then an expert nailing it.
- Remember this is not fixing the problem, it's giving you a window to maximize your efficiency in fixing the problem.

#### Tightness is the signal/symptom it is not the problem.

[Mental Pain](/mental-pain) => Anxiety => Signal to Focus => Instead of asking why am I anxious, and what am I trying to control, how do I maximize my influence

Physical Pain => Tightness => Signal to Focus => Instead of asing how do I loosen, ask what is weak? how do I strengthen.

#### Negative Feedback loop - When you're tight.

Your body is designed to operate smoothly and symettrically. However, we can also operate with mitigations, but those are of course increasing our injury risk. So if we're tight on one side we compensate, and that puts us at higher risk of future injury

#### Flexiblity vs Mobility

- Flexibility - How far you can move through a range of motion

  - Stiffness
  - Ligament
  - Joint Connection (Like with Hip ball and socket, or ankle flexion))

- Mobility - How far you can move through a range of motion under your own power
  - Strength Limited

#### So why do we do massage, and stretch

Because while that tightness is a symptom, it's also limiting range of motion, and by loosening (even temporarily), we can be more effective at strengthing (again exactly the same as anxiety in mental pain).

### Back Pain

#### Stuart McGill And the Big 3

If you've heard of the McGill big three, that's this guy. Trivia tidbits:

1. He did self experimentatin by sticking a needle into every muscle and zapping it with electricity to improve diagnosis
1. He broke his cervical spine
1. He is candian, and a professor of Waterloo (my Alama Matter)
