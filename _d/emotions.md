Ever notice how emotions are like that one friend who shows up uninvited and fucks up your perfectly planned party? Sometimes they bring cake and make everything awesome, other times they're drunk and knocking over your carefully arranged furniture while screaming "YOLO!" Well, here's your guide to that emotional party crasher living rent-free in your head, because let's face it - they're not moving out anytime soon.

| Negative Emotions  | Expression                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |

| [Guilt](/shame)    | I fucked up.               |
| [Regret](/regrets) | I wish I hadn't fucked up. |
| Blame              | You fucked up.             |

| Reframe                         | We all fuck up sometimes-it's part of life. |
| Dialectic\*                     | I fucked up, and I'm learning how not to.   |
| [Accountability](/be-proactive) | When I fuck up, I address it.               |

| Wonder            | What the actual fuck! (in a good way) |
| Flow              | Too fucking focused to fuck up!       |

| Sublime States             | Expression                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| [Sublime States](/sublime) |                                       |
| Loving-kindness            | Fucking love everyone!                |
| Compassion                 | Fuck, I feel your pain.               |
| Altruistic Joy             | Fuck yeah, you did it!                |
| Equanimity                 | No fucks to give, and that's perfect. |

(\*) Dialectic means holding two seemingly contradictory truths at once - like "I messed up" AND "I'm growing from it"

## PANAS Personality Types

The PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) is a scientific tool that measures how intensely you experience positive and negative emotions. Based on your scores, you fall into one of four personality types that explain a lot about how you navigate life.

| Type              | Positive Affect | Negative Affect | The Vibe                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mad Scientist** | High            | High            | "I feel EVERYTHING intensely!" Creative genius meets emotional tornado. You're passionate, innovative, but need to manage those mood swings. |
| **Cheerleader**   | High            | Low             | "Life is fucking awesome!" Natural optimist who spreads joy but might miss warning signs because everything looks rosy.                      |
| **Judge**         | Low             | High            | "Something's wrong here..." Critical thinker who spots problems others miss but might need help finding the silver linings.                  |
| **Poet**          | Low             | Low             | "Hmm, interesting..." Calm observer with steady emotions, great at staying zen but might need to actively cultivate excitement.              |

### What Your Type Means For You

**Mad Scientists**: You're the creative powerhouses who experience life in technicolor. Your challenge? Channel that intensity productively. When negative emotions hit, they hit HARD - but so does your joy. Learn to surf those waves instead of drowning in them.

**Cheerleaders**: You're everyone's favorite person to have around. Your superpower is finding the bright side, but watch out - sometimes you need to acknowledge the storm clouds before they become hurricanes. Practice sitting with negative emotions instead of always pushing them away.

**Judges**: You've got the gift of spotting what's wrong before it becomes a disaster. Your critical eye is valuable, but remember to actively look for what's going right too. Schedule regular "appreciation practices" to balance your natural negativity bias.

**Poets**: You're the zen masters who don't get rattled easily. Your emotional stability is a gift, but sometimes you need to actively pump up the volume on positive experiences. Seek out activities that spark joy and excitement - you might need to work harder at it than others.
