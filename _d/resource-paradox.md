Work expands to fill the resources available. The more you make, the more you spend. Stuff accumulates to fill the available storage space. And if you want something done, give it to a busy person.

## Why

This phenomenon relates to both the long tail and the Pareto principle, which states that you get 80% of the value from 20% of the work. Without resource constraints (or a deliberate focus on opportunity costs), you'll continue working long past the point of diminishing returns. Several related concepts help explain this behavior: the sunk cost fallacy, bike shedding, the IKEA effect, and loss aversion.

## Mitigation in General

### Decide ahead of time the stopping criteria

### Set a budget first

### Focus on trade-offs

## Mitigating at work

### Amazon's Leadership Principle - Frugality

Frugality is perhaps Amazon's most misunderstood [Leadership Principle](/amazon). While many people think it's about saving $100 by buying a door desk (which, ironically, ends up being more expensive since custom-cut desks aren't reusable), it's actually about accomplishing with five people what you thought would require eight.

This constraint forces you to focus solely on what matters most—the highest-impact work.

### Minimum Viable Products

### There is no truth in the building

### Ship before you are ready

### Day 2 culture

## Mitigating at the bank

This applies to [money](/money)

### Pay yourself first

### Focus on your expenses, not on your income

### Focus on your recurring expenses, not on capital expenses

## Mitigating on vacation

This applies during [time off](/time-off)

## Mitigating in the closet

### The art of tidying up

When cleaning your closet, removing items one at a time leads to Zeno's paradox—you'll keep removing half of what remains but never reach the end. Instead, the effective approach is to empty your closet completely and only return the items you truly need. This method forces you to make intentional decisions about each item rather than falling into the trap of endless incremental decluttering.

- Work complicates to fill the available time.
- Work contracts to fit in the time we give it.
- Data expands to fill the space available for storage.
- In ten hours a day, you have time to fall twice as far behind your commitments as in five hours a day.
- If you wait until the last minute, it only takes a minute to do.
