## Models

### Marginal costs - just this once

Never assume just this once, assume it'll happen forever, because it will. Standard story:

Skipping church or skipping meditation.

### Strategy : Defined vs Emergent

### Types of capabilities - Resources, Process, Values

### Being a class act

- NEVER speak badly of anyone
- Only what you'd say to their face.
- Take full responsibility
- Give all credit to others.

### Knowledge vs Wisdom

- Knowledge - The rider knows it.
- Wisdom - The elephant knows it.
- How to train the elephant? Curiosity

### Curiosity

- Feels good
- Self Awareness, focus on 'how curious' instead of cognitive
- How curious, is less judgmental

### Cognitive vs Curiosity based improvement

- Reframe
- Cognitive Control (rider) is hard, BUT curiosity is much easier.
- Curiosity does not take discipline, just awareness.
- From Curiosity, can make progress.

### Love and rejection

- Afraid to love because fear of rejection
- Very common statement, in the grand, but happens in the small too.
- Someone needed a charger, I could give it to them, but i didn't.
- Why? fear of rejection.
- Win/Win
  - I offer/needed - Someone feels loved, and I feel great - WIN!
  - I offer/not needed/Appreciate - Someone feels loved, I feel great - WIN!
  - I offer/not needed/grumpy - Someone feels angry, I feel sad - LOSS! (how often?)

_surprise: these are my daily affirmations_

- Deliberate, Disciplined, Daily
- Essentialism (I choose to do the most important thing)
- Appreciate
- First Understand, then be understated
- Provide Context

## Random Stuff

### From Clarisaa Magic Lecture

- Take the peas out of your shoes. If something causes a problem, even a tiny one fix it as it can drag on for ever. Plus fixing it makes you happy
  - Her example w ssetting up her suit case so that she everything had a place. That way she could see if she had forgotten anything, and it was perfect
- Keep the core there, but leave in space to pack in new stuff
  - Core suit case, but another suit case of new stuff, that way always have a good show, but don't get bored.
  - When stuff get good graduate it into the core
- Focus on the remembering self in interactions with others
  - How will co-workers remember you in the future? Focus on the moments.

### Yak Shaving

<http://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html>

"Yak shaving." Our very own Carlin Vieri invented the term, and yet
it has not caught on within the lab. This is a shame, because it
describes all too well what I find myself doing all too often.

You see, yak shaving is what you are doing when you're doing some
stupid, fiddly little task that bears no obvious relationship to what
you're supposed to be working on, but yet a chain of twelve causal
relations links what you're doing to the original meta-task.

Here's an example:

"I was working on my thesis and realized I needed a reference. I'd
seen a post on comp.arch recently that cited a paper, so I fired up
gnus. While I was searching the for the post, I came across another
post whose MIME encoding screwed up my ancient version of gnus, so I
stopped and downloaded the latest version of gnus.

"Unfortunately, the new version of gnus didn't work with emacs 18, so
I downloaded and built emacs 20. Of course, then I had to install
updated versions of a half-dozen other packages to keep other users
from hurting me. When I finally tried to use the new gnus, it kept
crapping out on my old configuration. And that's why I'm deep in the
gnus info pages and my .emacs file -- and yet it's all part of working
on my thesis."

And that, my friends, is yak shaving. (Not that this particular
example happened to me recently or anything.)
