Everyone can make a mistake once, that's totally fine. Repeating mistakes is unacceptable. Correction of Errors (COE) is the name Amazon gives it's mechanism for correcting errors. Microsoft uses the term Root cause analysis (RCA), it's the same concept. This mechanism originated with service outages but can be applied for any "error", like missing your sons kindergarten graduation, or getting fired.
