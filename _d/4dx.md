The 4 Disciplines of Execution (4DX) is a proven framework for executing your most important strategic priorities in the midst of the whirlwind of day-to-day demands. This framework has been tested and refined by hundreds of organizations and thousands of teams over many years.

## The Challenge: The Whirlwind

The whirlwind is the day-to-day operations that consume most of our time and energy. It's the urgent activities required to keep things running. While the whirlwind is important (it's your day job, after all), it can make it difficult to execute new strategic goals.

## Discipline 1: Focus on the Wildly Important

The first discipline teaches us that we must identify and focus on the one or two goals that will make all the difference. The more you try to do, the less you accomplish. This is the law of diminishing returns.

This principle aligns deeply with two other powerful frameworks:

The essentialist approach teaches us that we must be incredibly selective about what we choose to focus on. Key principles include:

- "I choose to" not "I have to"
- Only a few things matter, not everything is important
- We can do one thing exceptionally well, rather than many things poorly
- If it's not a clear "Hell Yes," it should be a "No"

{% include summarize-page.html src="/end-in-mind" %}

From the 7 Habits framework, we learn that all things are created twice: first in the mind (planning), then in reality (execution). When focusing on the wildly important:

- Begin with a clear vision of the end result
- Create explicit, validated criteria for what success looks like
- Make sure your goals align with your deeper values and purpose

Key principles for focusing on the wildly important:

- Focus on the vital few instead of the trivial many
- Create clear finish lines with specific deadlines
- Define what winning looks like in measurable terms
- Make your goals specific and actionable
- Ensure everyone on the team understands why these goals matter

## Discipline 2: Act on Lead Measures

There are two types of measures: lag and lead measures.

- Lag measures track the goal you're trying to achieve
- Lead measures track the behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures

The key is to focus on the lead measures - the things you can influence directly.

## Discipline 3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard

People play differently when they're keeping score. A compelling scoreboard tells the team where they are and where they should be, at a glance.

Elements of a compelling scoreboard:

- Simple
- Visible
- Shows both lead and lag measures
- Can tell at a glance if you're winning or losing

## Discipline 4: Create a Cadence of Accountability

Regular accountability sessions are where execution happens. These weekly meetings (WIG sessions) follow a specific format:

1. Report on last week's commitments
2. Review the scoreboard
3. Make commitments for the coming week
