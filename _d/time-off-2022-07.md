It's FISM (olympics of magic), and I'm going to Quebec city to reenergize my love of magic, since I'm already in Canada I'll also spend time with My Mom, Sister, and college room mate.

This is a combination of [time off](/time-off), and all the stuff for [happiness](/happy), which I guess gets tangled up with half of my evergreen notes.

## My top priorities

### Maintain Healthy habits

- Keep my weight at 200 lbs (though dropping 5 extra would be amazing
- Maintaining my mobilily, and cardio routine (can skip strength)
- Maintaining my emotional health habits
- Minimize Procrastination
- Disconnect from work as soon as I'm done work.

### Other

- Get my Mom setup with fresh electronics
- Enjoy the magic
- Feel got the most out of vacation

### No buffer between vacation and work

To preserve time-off with the family. I'm working the first few days of my canada trip. While the flexibility is great, I wonder if I'll have trouble disconnecting, and would be better off using some of that time to do initial decompression.

I guess if I do, I can take the time off.
