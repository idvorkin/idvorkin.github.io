title: Time off November 2022 - New York with Ammon, and Then Maureen and Brian for Thanksgiving
---

It's just about thanksgiving 2022, and after 2 years of not being able to go to Oregon, we're on our away! Through unexpected timing, before going to Oregon, I'm going to New York City with Ammon, and through even more unexpected timing, we just had lay offs at work, and have a major re-organization. Instead of being able to fully take the time off, I'll be working several days, so having clarity on my priorities is critical.

The first leg of my trip is NYC. Turns out Ammon loves musicals, and every year he makes a pilgrimage to broadway to be able to see like 14 musicals in 7 days.

6 months ago, Ammon was saying he loves these trips, but his wife Elise and his kids find them overwhelming and he has to go alone. I'm like "Well, I can work from the Facebook office in NYC, and seeing some shows will be fun". (Not nearly as many shows as Ammon though). We decided back then to book the week before Thanksgiving.

These posts are a combination of [time off](/time-off), and all the stuff for [happiness](/happy), which I guess gets tangled up with half of my evergreen notes.

## My top priorities

### Maintain Healthy habits

- Keep my weight at 180 lbs (though dropping an extra 2 lbs would be amazing)
- Maintaining a daily workout, at least stretching, cardio every other day.
- Maintain my daily meditation and daily journal.
- Check in on my streaks app - it'll keep me honest
- If I don't care what I'm eating, eat a big bowl of popcorn
- Don't eat junk food cuz it's cheap/free.
- Throw away half my meal before I start
- Take lots of photos

### Keep work at work.

The last 2 months have been stressful at work, and I've been spending lots of time thinking about work at home, as a reminder to myself:

{%include summarize-page.html src='/mind-at-work' %}

Two days before the start of the trip we had layoffs (including my partners who help the team while I'm out), and a giant re-org where the team I support will be doing something completely new and I have a new boss, and this is all starting to be figured out while I'm on my flight to New York. I expect there will be lots of meetings and many decisions being made, and I'll be working on EST with hard stops to make 300$ shows booked months ago. So here are my rules:

- Disconnect from work as soon as I'm done work.
- Be really calendar focused to get the time to be used deliberately.
- Set expectations on what I can and can not attend
- Realize I have lots of time to catch up async before everyone comes to work
- Co-ordinate with my tech lead to have maximum coverage.
- No looking at work on my phone (a bad habit I picked up the last few days due to layoffs).

### Other

- Experience New York, it's an amazing city.
- Feel got the most out of vacation

## Executive Summary

## Moments

- Getting to tell Ammon all the stuff in my life in the first 2 hours of our flight
- Doing ballon for kid on the bus
- Seeing Harry Potter and crying
- Poop story from cofffee shop
- Not eating the M&Ms at the store
- To Learn : Anniversaryj card
- To Re-Learn : Monkey and Other ballooing things (Make blog post to remember)
- Doing balloon trick for kid that didn't want to be good on stage
- Super funny commedy show, with wings and super funny singing guy
- Boarding guy at the airport, treating folks to increaes energy liike they do at a comedy club, truly welcoming and thanking everyone.

**Remember the peak end rule**

### Missing important stuff in critical time at work.

See the section about keep work at work.
