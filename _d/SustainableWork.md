# Sustainable work

## Why

Close your eyes - Imagine knowing you're about to die within a few days and sharing your regrets with your grown up child. Do you want to tell them: "I wished I hadn't worked so much", "I wish I'd spent more time with my family", "I wished I'd taken care of my health"? I don't, and I bet you don't either.

Great Leaders begin with the end in mind, prioritize ruthlessly, and seek sustainable solutions. This means building a culture where people don't need to sacrifice their family, health, and lives for work. In modern management speak - work life balance.

Conveniently, a sustainable work culture attracts the best people, which builds high performing team, which delivers superb business results.

Conversely, unsustainable team culture, results in resentment, burnout, and your best people leaving.

## How

Each person will have their own path to sustainability. I wil share how I role model sustainability, and what structural mechanisms I build to help it permiate into my organizations.

Sustainable organizations require structural processes to support the culture. Here are some structures I put in place into my teams:

-   To support working remotely, have chat rooms, high quality microphones, and meetings with video conferencing capabilities.
-   To ensure people can go home guilt free, have no meetings after 4.
-   To encourage people to take care of themselves, have an [unlimited vacation policy](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/269989) including taking extra days off during the holidays.

Skeptical people expect these processes will be abused, but in all the teams I've instituted it's never been a problem. If anything, it encourages a high performing team by encouraging the team to cover each other when folks want time off.

Organizations reflect their leaders, and I try my best to model sustianabilty. Of course there are times where I miss Some of my personal behaviors:

-   Leave every day at 4, and don't touch work evenings and weekends.
-   I don't have work e-mail on my phone.
-   Sneak out mid day to get to events that are important to my children.
-   Take lieu time if I've needed to work too much recently.

### Planning

### Defending Boundaries

## Managing up

### No meetings after 4

### TBD: Don't send mails on the weekends

## Organizational change

When I joined a new organization, I was amazed that at noon Friday a director called a meeting for 4pm-5pm on the same Friday. The next Monday, I walked into the director's office and said "How much will I need to pay you to not have meetings after 4?" The director asked "Why?". I explained that I come in early, and like to leave by 4. The director then asked "Hymn, should we have no meetings after 3?". I replied 4 should be fine, and that was that. No meetings after 4.

## FAQ

#### Your time off policy sounds great, but I want to write code

Building code muscles is great - I highly recomend it. I believe the best way to do that is to work on a side project or to take courses, and read a great programming book.

#### Really, you do this

Like everyone else, my goals are aspirational and sometimes I miss. But I highly value feedback and expect my co-workers to hold me accountable when I'm not doing it.

#### How many hours do you work a week

My goal is to work 40-50 hours. I will not check e-mail on the evenings or weekends, but I do spend a bunch of time on professional development like coding side projects and reading books on emotional intelligence.

#### What's a typical work day

I'm a morning person, and like to roll out of bed at 5am and start working by 5:30. I try to get in 2 hour block from 5:30-7:30am. At 7:30 I walk my son to school, then bike to work. I'm at work by 9am, and then work till 4pm. Once I leave, I'm strict about unplugging. Unless there's a fire, I will not check e-mail or work from home. Because this has me working 45 hours/week, I have no guilt leaving in the middle of the day for my daughters dance performances, or to catch up with a friend who's visiting town.

#### Have you ever burned out

Yes. I've burned out 3 times in my career. The first time, I just became a senior developor, just had my first child, and just bought my first house. The second time, I put my team in a position where they were setup for failure, and I didn't know how to declare success and move on. The third time, I didn't realize I was operating under extremly unrealistic expecations and didn't have support structure I needed.

#### Man this sounds awesome, but my boss has me completely overloaded

That's a hard position. My thoughts on task overload are [here](http://ig2600.blogspot.com/search?q=overload).

#### Did you always do this

No, when I was young and single, I wanted to build my tech muslces as fast as I could and often worked 50-60 hours a week. When I started Azure, I and the entire team worked 60 hours a week, and it was one of the funest times in my career.

#### I'm young and single - I want to work like a dog - should I

Sure! That's what I did. If you want to do this, you're welcome in my team, but I'd recommend doing it in a team that is all working like a dog, you'll have more fun!
