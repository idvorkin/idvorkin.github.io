A running journal of days that actually worked - the ones where health habits stuck, family time hit different, or I remembered what it feels like to be fully alive. Not every day needs to be Instagram-worthy, but some days deserve a bookmark. This is that bookmark collection.

## The Chronicles

### 2025-10-04

**The Setup:** First real entry! A Saturday that felt like it had 48 hours in it, in the best way.

**How It Went:**

- **4:45am** - Up and at 'em. My 5am Igor showing up strong. The world is quiet, my brain is sharp.

- **4:45-6am** - Writing session. This is when the good stuff happens - before the world wakes up and starts demanding things.

  - Updated [Alfred workflows for OmniFocus automation support](https://gist.github.com/idvorkin/3dc1063731687e869d77dd296ac9b1ff)
  - Fixed up [nlp commit.py handlers to be faster](https://gist.github.com/idvorkin/c31ce489f2ae88942ee3f873b126d99c)
  - Because apparently 5am Igor loves optimizing task management

- **6-7:45am** - [Hansel](TBD) came over to work on his podcast. Social connection happening naturally, not as something I had to schedule.

- **8am** - Drove to the gym. The transition from creation mode to physical mode.

- **8-10am** - Two-hour gym session. The kind where you leave feeling like you earned your body.

- **10am-1pm** - Joe Guppy's comedy writing class. Jury's still out on whether I'll enjoy it, but I showed up. That counts.

- **1pm** - Professional Uber Driverâ„¢ mode activated. Drove Zach and his "super smart kids" crew to lunch at Golden Gardens. (See [gap year post](/gap-year-igor#the-squander-dragon-dialog) for the full philosophy on why this matters.)

  - In the car they played this game: phone picks a random letter, guess a country that starts with it
  - But wait - they had _rules_: No politically disputed countries, no historical country names, no regions
  - Then someone suggested switching to second letter instead of first
  - Group consensus: "Too hard" - they workshopped the difficulty curve like game designers
  - Watching Zach hang out with his friends was awesome!

- **Mid-lunch wait** - The kids were goofing around, so I had unexpected time. Meditated at Golden Gardens instead of doom-scrolling. Turned dead time into mindful time.

  - Thankfully I have my meditation bench in the car (along with everything else)

- **Still waiting** - Recorded a Fortune Cookie video. Found the gap in the schedule and used it. Already in the right headspace from meditating.

- **3:30pm** - Got home. The 15-minute drive was worth it - caught Zach laughing with his friends, which is its own kind of treasure.

- **3:30-6pm** - Uploaded [Fortune Cookie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQsgbcUup2M&list=PLJveOxX-mxxBsIsk83fr0sb3i7RdpaJbF), made many [blog updates (including this very post - meta!)](https://gist.github.com/idvorkin/eeab76b0d7560be4d8c6fa900d8b44e5).
- **Uncategorized** - Very good eating
- **Odd things about yesterday**
  - First run in like 3 years. (2 min on, 3 min walk) Ã— 5. Gotta start slow to avoid injury.
  - Decided to start a [reverse bucket list](/bucket-list) and get rid of my [juggling torches](http://ig66.blogspot.com/2014/08/accomplishment-unlocked-juggling-file.html?q=torches). Time to practice wanting less.

A perfect day.

  - Did a magic trick for a family on the subway who loved it
  - Biked up the main drag of downtown

- **8:15am** - Got to work and started the day.

  - Found and cleared a bottleneck for my most important Holiday Project

- **Post-swim** - Took Zach and Amelia to Beth's for milkshakes because Zach did 14 laps at the pool.
