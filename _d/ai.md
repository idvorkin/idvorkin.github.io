## Ideas/Thoughts/Tidbits

### AI in larger context/Democratization of Knowledge Expertise.

Yukky, clean this section up to stand on its own

Each major leap in technology reduces scarcity in a fundamental area:

- Agriculture → Cheap Food & Human Stability
- Metalworking → Cheap Tools & Cheap Warfare
- Writing & Money → Cheap Knowledge & Cheap Trade
- Printing Press → Cheap Information & Cheap Literacy
- Industrial Revolution → Cheap Physical Power
- Electricity → Cheap Standardized Work
- Computing → Cheap Logic & Cheap Automation
- AI → Cheap Expertise & Cheap Decision-Making

Diving into the final one, expertise becomes cheap. What will that mean?
**Computing (Cheap Information Processing & Logic) vs. AI (Cheap Expertise & Decision-Making)**

Computing (Revolution 7) and AI (Revolution 8) seem similar because both involve automation and data processing, but they differ in **what they make cheap** and **what types of human labor they replace**.

Revolution 7: Computing → Cheap Information Processing & Cheap Logic\*\*

🔹 **Key Idea:** Computers automate calculations, data storage, and repetitive logical processes.
🔹 **What Became Cheap?**

- **Mathematical calculations** (spreadsheets replacing accountants).
- **Data storage & retrieval** (databases replacing file cabinets).
- **Repetitive logic-based tasks** (software replacing clerks).
  🔹 **What It Replaced?**
- Bookkeepers, clerks, human "computers" (pre-electronic era math workers).
- Manual data entry and processing jobs.
- Logic-based human decision-making (e.g., tax software vs. accountants).
  🔹 **Limitations:**
- Computers execute **strict rules**—if a situation isn't pre-programmed, they fail.
- They don't "understand" problems—only process logic as instructed.
- They require **explicit programming** to function (if X, then Y).

**Examples of Revolution 7 (Computing in Action)**

✅ **Excel & Spreadsheets** → Automated business calculations.
✅ **Databases & Search Engines** → Made finding and storing information instant.
✅ **Enterprise Software (ERP, CRM, etc.)** → Automated workflows in businesses.
✅ **Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** → Automates repetitive digital tasks.

**Revolution 8: AI → Cheap Expertise & Cheap Decision-Making**

🔹 **Key Idea:** AI automates **knowledge work** and **decision-making**, reducing reliance on experts.
🔹 **What Became Cheap?**

- **Pattern recognition & prediction** (AI detects fraud, diseases, and legal risks).
- **Creative & analytical work** (AI writes code, generates content, and composes music).
- **Decision-making under uncertainty** (AI assists in law, finance, hiring, and medicine).
  🔹 **What It Replaced?**
- Lawyers, doctors, financial analysts (partially).
- Writers, artists, and software developers (for certain tasks).
- Customer support agents (chatbots replacing tier-1 help desks).
  🔹 **Key Difference from Computing:**
- AI **isn't explicitly programmed** with rules—it learns from data.
- AI **generalizes** beyond its training data (unlike traditional computing).
- AI can operate **without human supervision** in some cases (self-driving cars, trading bots).

**Examples of Revolution 8 (AI in Action)**

✅ **GPT & Large Language Models** → Replacing copywriters, summarizing complex texts.
✅ **DALL·E & Midjourney** → Generating art and replacing some graphic designers.
✅ **AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis** → Radiology AI reading scans as well as human doctors.
✅ **Autonomous Systems (FSD, AI Traders, AI Lawyers)** → Reducing human expertise dependency.

| **Category**                 | **Computing (Cheap Logic & Processing)**        | **AI (Cheap Expertise & Decision-Making)**        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Key Advantage**            | Automates structured, rule-based logic          | Automates expertise & decision-making             |
| **Requires Explicit Rules?** | ✅ Yes                                          | ❌ No (learns from data)                          |
| **Handles Uncertainty?**     | ❌ No                                           | ✅ Yes (probabilistic reasoning)                  |
| **Data Type**                | Structured (numbers, databases)                 | Unstructured (text, images, voice)                |
| **Replaces**                 | Clerks, bookkeepers, programmers (to an extent) | Lawyers, doctors, writers, artists                |
| **Examples**                 | Excel, SQL, ERP, Payroll Software               | ChatGPT, Midjourney, AlphaFold, Self-Driving Cars |

**How AI Goes Beyond Traditional Computing**

**1. From Fixed Logic to Adaptive Learning**

- **Computing (7)** → If you want a system to identify spam emails, you write rules like:
  **"If email contains 'Nigerian prince,' mark as spam."**
- **AI (8)** → AI **learns** by analyzing millions of spam emails, finding hidden patterns humans might miss.

**2. From Simple Automation to Complex Decision-Making**

- **Computing (7)** → An e-commerce site's software follows fixed rules:
  **"If order > $50, apply free shipping."**
- **AI (8)** → AI **optimizes** shipping costs dynamically, predicts demand, and personalizes discounts for individual customers.

**3. From Human Input to Autonomous Systems**

- **Computing (7)** → A self-driving car must follow **predefined rules** ("Stop at red light, Go at green").
- **AI (8)** → AI **interprets the environment** using neural networks, making real-time driving decisions.

If **Computing made logic cheap** and **AI made expertise cheap**, what's next?

1. **AI + Robotics → Cheap Skilled Physical Labor**
   - AI-powered robots replacing **electricians, plumbers, chefs, surgeons**.
   - AI-driven factories with **zero human workers**.

2. **AI + Biology → Cheap Health & Longevity**
   - AI designing **new drugs & personalized treatments**.
   - AI managing healthcare, **eliminating most routine doctor visits**.

3. **AI + Generalized Automation → Cheap Everything?**
   - **Fully automated businesses** (AI CEO, AI employees, AI customer service).
   - AI predicting and **managing global supply chains**.

🚀 The jump from **Computing to AI** was about **moving from automation of logic to automation of intelligence**.
🚀 The next leap might be **from automation of intelligence to automation of reality.**

Would you like to focus on a particular area of Revolution 8 or explore Revolution 9 in more depth? 🚀

### Examples of Alchemy

- Doing worst job in dec, (and July for European models) - [crappy source](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/ai-might-take-a-winter-break-as-gpt-4-turbo-apparently-learns-from-us-to-wind-down-for-the-holidays)
- Doing a better job if you say you are stressed
- Telling the LLM not to hallucinate (fascinating, this only works now, not in early models as early training data didn't talk about hallucinations)

### How do LLMs think?

- "Complete the next word" is super hard. Imagine a big long mystery novel, and then the next sentence is - And the killer was .... That requires a very deep understanding
- LLMs currently are very "fast thinking" from the thinking fast and slow book.
- [AI Mental Breakdown and getting help from another LLM](https://x.com/AISafetyMemes/status/1829059756818084059)

### LLM training efficiency

- LLMs are trained very inefficiently. Imagine teaching a kid by making them read everything and see what happens most.
- In the future rewards based on process , not outcome (e.g did I take a good first step, vs did I get the right answer).
- We train LLMs based on hard/easy for humans, what about when we do it by stuff that is hard/easy for LLMs

### It's not good enough today

- Imagine saying that of a pre-school student.
- In 2024, we have gpt-4o (high school student), 2 years ago, we had a pre-schooler.
- What will we have in 2 more years?

### Where will we get the OOMs - Order Of Magnitude Improvements

See situational Awareness

- Compute power: The essay mentions an increase of "~0.5 orders of magnitude or OOMs/year" in compute power - . This is driven by the rapid expansion of computing infrastructure, with plans for trillion-dollar compute clusters and hundreds of millions of GPUs being deployed across the United States.
- Algorithmic efficiencies: Another "~0.5 OOMs/year" is expected to come from improvements in AI algorithms- . These advancements are likely to enhance the capabilities of AI systems significantly.
- "Unhobbling" gains: LLMs have latent capabilities (for example when they use Chain Of Thought). By using that, we get a boost. How many more such boosts are there.
- AI research automation: Once AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is achieved, the essay suggests that "Hundreds of millions of AGIs could automate AI research, compressing a decade of algorithmic progress (5+ OOMs) into ≤1 year" - This rapid acceleration in AI capabilities could lead to a dramatic increase in overall intelligence.
