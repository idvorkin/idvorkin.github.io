### Ideas/Thoughts/Tidbits

### Examples of Alchamey

- Doing worst job in dec, (and July for European models) - [crappy source](https://www.techradar.com/computing/artificial-intelligence/ai-might-take-a-winter-break-as-gpt-4-turbo-apparently-learns-from-us-to-wind-down-for-the-holidays)

### How do LLMs think?

- "Complete the next word" is super hard. Imagine a big long mystery novel, and then the next sentence is - And the killer was .... That requires a very deep understanding
- LLMs currently are very "fast thinking" from the thinking fast and slow book.

### LLM training efficiency

- LLMs are trained very inefficiently. Imagine teaching a kid by making them read everything and see what happens most.
- In the future rewards based on process , not outcome (e.g did I take a good first step, vs did I get the right answer).
- We train LLMs based on hard/easy for humans, what about when we do it by stuff that is hard/easy for LLMs

### It's not good enough today

- Imagine saying that of a pre-school student.
- In 2024, we have gpt-4o (high school student), 2 years ago, we had a pre-schooler.
- What will we have in 2 more years?

### Where will we get the OOMs - Order Of Magnitude Improvements

See situational Awareness

- Compute power: The essay mentions an increase of "~0.5 orders of magnitude or OOMs/year" in compute power - . This is driven by the rapid expansion of computing infrastructure, with plans for trillion-dollar compute clusters and hundreds of millions of GPUs being deployed across the United States.
- Algorithmic efficiencies: Another "~0.5 OOMs/year" is expected to come from improvements in AI algorithms- . These advancements are likely to enhance the capabilities of AI systems significantly.
- "Unhobbling" gains: LLMs have latent capabilities (for example when they use Chain Of Thought). By using that, we get a boost. How many more such boosts are there.
- AI research automation: Once AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is achieved, the essay suggests that "Hundreds of millions of AGIs could automate AI research, compressing a decade of algorithmic progress (5+ OOMs) into ≤1 year" - This rapid acceleration in AI capabilities could lead to a dramatic increase in overall intelligence.
