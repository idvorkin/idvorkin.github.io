## Who is my audience/what is my purpose?

{%include summarize-page.html src="/content-audience" %}

## The Basics

## Hardware

### KISS: The best equipment is what you have on you.

### Your Phone

Your phone—make most content here.

### Don't lose it

I put air-tags on everything, and since the cases don't come with that, I stick them in elevation lab holders. I have them on everything, 100% worth it.

#### AirTag (4 Pack)

{% include amazon.html asin="B0D54JZTHY" %}

#### Elevation Labs TagVault

{% include amazon.html asin="B09ZVPWKK3" %}

### Microphone

- You can use an external mic, but I usually don't.
- I got the something or other, which is nice as it has stereo mics. Not sure this has solved any problem I have.

{% include amazon.html asin="B0DNQ8CLXR" %}

### Selfie Drone - Hover X1

- Careful, don't lose it. That happens a lot.

### DJI Pocket 3

- Just got it looks like it's gonna be really fun.
- After the novelty wore off I stopped using it.

### Insta360 X5

- 360-degree camera that captures everything around you
- What's great is you just record it in 360, then use really nice AI features to find the best view.
- Does a nice auto upload to web
- Can put on table and record both sides of the conversation

### Never use it: Action Camera

- Too much work.

### Never use it: DSLR

- Too much work.

### External Hard Drive

- Pretty useful, I have a 4 TB ultra-fast hard drive. Copy everything over; otherwise, you'll fill up all your storage.

### Webcams: OBS Tiny Cam

- Pretty sweet, built-in gimbal.
- Has a remote control which is great.

## Software

### Screencasts

{%include summarize-page.html src="/screencast" %}

### Vertical ShortForm Video

Killer, just take video on your phone, then use CapCut to edit/auto-caption. It's always getting better. The key is: don't fight the app. If it wants to do stuff, let it. Over-trying to optimize is a waste of time.

- Best feature is AI Captions and AI editing.

## Pre-Production

### Planning

### Scripting

Having a script transforms your content from rambling to focused. But reading from a script while maintaining eye contact and natural delivery? That's where teleprompter software becomes invaluable.

**My Go-To App:**

**[Teleprompter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/teleprompter/id941620509)** (Free with Pro upgrade) - The app I actually use for mobile content creation. Import your scripts, adjust text size and scrolling speed, and record videos while reading. Works great for both iOS and Android.

**Note**: Just because you have a teleprompter doesn't mean you need to be fully scripted. You can also use it for key points to keep your content focused while maintaining a natural, conversational delivery.

**Pro Tips for Teleprompter Success:**
- **Font size matters**: Use large, readable fonts (24pt+)
- **Eye level**: Position screen at camera height to maintain natural eye contact
- **Pace yourself**: Write conversationally, include natural pauses
- **Practice first**: Run through without recording to nail timing
- **Backup plan**: Always have key points memorized in case tech fails

## Production

### Lighting

### Audio

### Camera Work

## Post-Production

### Editing

**CapCut** - My go-to editor for mobile content creation. It's a bit wonky to use, but like any other skill you need to build your muscles before you're good at using it. The AI features for captions and editing are excellent once you get the hang of it.

### Distribution

## AI Tools

### Thumbnails

### Transcription

## Monetization: The Reality Check

Creator monetization is complex and often disappointing. For a comprehensive guide covering all monetization methods, platform-specific strategies, and real earnings data:\n\n{% include summarize-page.html src="/monetize" %}

### Quick Summary

**The brutal truth**: 99% of creators make less than $100/month. Success requires:

- Multiple income streams
- Years of consistent content
- Genuine audience relationships
- Realistic expectations

**Main monetization methods**:

- Ad revenue sharing (YouTube, TikTok)
- Affiliate marketing (Amazon Associates)
- Brand sponsorships (where the real money is)
- Direct fan support (Patreon, tips)
- Digital products (courses, templates)
- Merchandise

For detailed breakdowns, case studies, and platform-specific strategies, see the [full monetization guide](/monetize).
