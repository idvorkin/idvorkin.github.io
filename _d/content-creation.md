## Who is my audience/what is my purpose?

{%include summarize-page.html src="/content-audience" %}

## The Basics

## Hardware

### KISS: The best equipment is what you have on you.

### Your Phone

Your phoneâ€”make most content here.

### Don't lose it

I put air-tags on everything, and since the cases don't come with that, I stick them in elevation lab holders. I have them on everything, 100% worth it.

#### AirTag (4 Pack)

{% include amazon.html asin="B0D54JZTHY" %}

#### Elevation Labs TagVault

{% include amazon.html asin="B09ZVPWKK3" %}

### Microphone

- You can use an external mic, but I usually don't.
- I got the something or other, which is nice as it has stereo mics. Not sure this has solved any problem I have.

{% include amazon.html asin="B0DNQ8CLXR" %}

### Selfie Drone - Hover X1

- Careful, don't lose it. That happens a lot.

### DJI Pocket 3

- Just got it looks like it's gonna be really fun.
- After the novelty wore off I stopped using it.

### Insta360 X5

- 360-degree camera that captures everything around you
- What's great is you just record it in 360, then use really nice AI features to find the best view.
- Does a nice auto upload to web
- Can put on table and record both sides of the conversation

### Never use it: Action Camera

- Too much work.

### Never use it: DSLR

- Too much work.

### External Hard Drive

- Pretty useful, I have a 4 TB ultra-fast hard drive. Copy everything over; otherwise, you'll fill up all your storage.

### Webcams: OBS Tiny Cam

- Pretty sweet, built-in gimbal.
- Has a remote control whih is great.

## Software

### Screencasts

{%include summarize-page.html src="/screencast" %}

### Vertical ShortForm Video

Killer, just take video on your phone, then use CapCut to edit/auto-caption. It's always getting better. The key is: don't fight the app. If it wants to do stuff, let it. Over-trying to optimize is a waste of time.

- Best feature is AI Captions and AI editing.

## Pre-Production

## Monetization: The Reality Check

Creator monetization is complex and often disappointing. For a comprehensive guide covering all monetization methods, platform-specific strategies, and real earnings data:\n\n{% include summarize-page.html src="/monetize" %}

### Quick Summary

**The brutal truth**: 99% of creators make less than $100/month. Success requires:

- Multiple income streams
- Years of consistent content
- Genuine audience relationships
- Realistic expectations

**Main monetization methods**:

- Ad revenue sharing (YouTube, TikTok)
- Affiliate marketing (Amazon Associates)
- Brand sponsorships (where the real money is)
- Direct fan support (Patreon, tips)
- Digital products (courses, templates)
- Merchandise

For detailed breakdowns, case studies, and platform-specific strategies, see the [full monetization guide](/monetize).
