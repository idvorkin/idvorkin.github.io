## The Basics

## Hardware

### KISS: The best equipment is what you have on you.

### Your Phone

Your phoneâ€”make most content here.

### Microphone

You can use an external mic, but I usually don't.

### Selfie Drone

- Careful, don't lose it. That happens a lot.

### DJI Pocket 3

### Never use it: Action Camera

- Too much work.

### Never use it: DSLR

- Too much work.

### External Hard Drive

- Pretty useful, I have a 4 TB ultra-fast hard drive. Copy everything over; otherwise, you'll fill up all your storage.

### Webcams: OBS Tiny Cam

- Pretty sweet, built-in gimbal.

## Software

### Screencasts

{%include summarize-page.html src="/screencast" %}

### Vertical ShortForm Video

Killer, just take video on your phone, then use CapCut to edit/auto-caption. It's always getting better. The key is: don't fight the app. If it wants to do stuff, let it. Over-trying to optimize is a waste of time.

- Best feature is AI Captions and AI editing.
