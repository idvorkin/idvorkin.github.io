## Who is my audience/what is my purpose?

{%include summarize-page.html src="/content-audience" %}

## The Basics

## Hardware

### KISS: The best equipment is what you have on you.

### Your Phone

Your phone—make most content here.

### Don't lose it

I put air-tags on everything, and since the cases don't come with that, I stick them in elevation lab holders. I have them on everything, 100% worth it.

#### AirTag (4 Pack)

{% include amazon.html asin="B0D54JZTHY" %}

#### Elevation Labs TagVault

{% include amazon.html asin="B09ZVPWKK3" %}

### Microphone

- You can use an external mic, but I usually don't.
- I got the something or other, which is nice as it has stereo mics. Not sure this has solved any problem I have.

{% include amazon.html asin="B0DNQ8CLXR" %}

### Selfie Drone - Hover X1

- Careful, don't lose it. That happens a lot.

### DJI Pocket 3

- Just got it looks like it's gonna be really fun.
- After the novelty wore off I stopped using it.

### Insta360 X5

- 360-degree camera that captures everything around you
- What's great is you just record it in 360, then use really nice AI features to find the best view.
- Does a nice auto upload to web
- Can put on table and record both sides of the conversation

### Never use it: Action Camera

- Too much work.

### Never use it: DSLR

- Too much work.

### External Hard Drive

- Pretty useful, I have a 4 TB ultra-fast hard drive. Copy everything over; otherwise, you'll fill up all your storage.

### Webcams: OBS Tiny Cam

- Pretty sweet, built-in gimbal.
- Has a remote control whih is great.

## Software

### Screencasts

{%include summarize-page.html src="/screencast" %}

### Vertical ShortForm Video

Killer, just take video on your phone, then use CapCut to edit/auto-caption. It's always getting better. The key is: don't fight the app. If it wants to do stuff, let it. Over-trying to optimize is a waste of time.

- Best feature is AI Captions and AI editing.

## Monetization: The Reality Check

Let's talk money – or more accurately, let's talk about why you probably won't make any. Creator monetization is like a lottery where everyone thinks they're going to win, but most people end up making less than minimum wage. Here's the brutal truth about each monetization model.

### The Hard Truth

Before we dive in, let's be clear: 99% of creators make less than $100/month. The top 1% make all the money, and even they hustle harder than you'd believe. If you're doing this for money, you're probably in the wrong game. Do it because you love it, and maybe – just maybe – the money will follow.

### Amazon Associates: The Classic Disappointment

Remember when I thought I'd make bank from those product links? LOL. Here's what they don't tell you:

**The 3 Sales Requirement (The Catch-22)**:

- You need 3 qualifying sales in your first 180 days just to keep your account
- But here's the kicker: Without product images, nobody clicks your links
- To get access to the Product Advertising API (for proper images), you need... wait for it... 3 qualifying sales!
- So you're stuck with ugly text links that nobody clicks, trying to get sales to earn the right to make your links clickable

**Other fun facts**:

- Commission rates are pathetic (1-4% for most categories, electronics are 1%!)
- Amazon discontinued SiteStripe image links in Dec 2023
- Cookie duration is only 24 hours (if someone buys tomorrow, you get nothing)
- They can change terms anytime – and frequently do
- Your account can be terminated for vague "violations"

**Reality**: It's a chicken-and-egg problem. You need sales to get tools that help you make sales. Unless you're reviewing products full-time with massive traffic, expect to make enough for a coffee... per year.

**Pro tip**: Need those 3 qualifying sales? Based on actual prices, here's what works:

{% include amazon.html asin="B0006BB9MG;B0050R67U0;B0737N6LWX" %}

- **Velcro Cable Ties** ($5.99) - 25-pack reusable cable ties. Everyone needs these for cable management
- **MagicFiber Cleaning Cloths** (~$5) - 6-pack premium microfiber cloths that actually work. Perfect for phones, glasses, screens
- **Reynolds Slow Cooker Liners Small** ($5.75 w/ Subscribe & Save) - 5-pack for 1-3 qt cookers. Makes cleanup a breeze

The key is recommending stuff people already need AND can actually afford. With Subscribe & Save, these all stay under $6. Pro tip: Tell people about Subscribe & Save for that extra 5-15% off!

### YouTube: The Long Game

YouTube monetization sounds great until you realize:

- You need 1,000 subscribers AND 4,000 watch hours to even apply
- Most creators make $1-3 per 1,000 views (if you're lucky)
- YouTube takes 45% of ad revenue
- Advertisers can pull out anytime (remember the "adpocalypse"?)
- Your content needs to be "advertiser-friendly" (bye bye, edgy content)

**Reality**: A video with 100K views might make you $100-300. Most videos get under 1K views.

### TikTok Creator Fund: Pennies for Views

TikTok's creator fund is almost insulting:

- Pay rate: $0.02-0.04 per 1,000 views (yes, you read that right)
- A viral video with 1M views = maybe $20-40
- Requirements keep changing
- Not available in all countries
- They can kick you out for mysterious "violations"

**Reality**: TikTok is for building an audience, not direct monetization.

### Sponsorships: The Real Money

This is where actual money exists, but:

- Brands want established creators with engaged audiences
- Rates vary wildly ($20-100+ per 1,000 followers)
- You need media kits, rate cards, contracts
- FTC requires disclosure (those #ad tags)
- One bad sponsorship can tank your credibility

**Reality**: This is the most lucrative path, but you need serious numbers first.

### Digital Products: Build Once, Sell Forever

Courses, presets, templates, ebooks – the dream of passive income:

- High profit margins (near 100%)
- You control everything
- But... you need an audience that trusts you
- Creating quality products takes serious time
- Customer support never ends
- Refunds and chargebacks are real

**Reality**: Works great if you have expertise people will pay for. Most don't.

### Patreon/Memberships: Your True Fans

The "1,000 true fans" model:

- Predictable monthly income
- Direct relationship with supporters
- But... you need to deliver consistent value
- Platform fees (5-12%)
- Payment processing fees (2.9% + $0.30)
- Churn is real (people cancel all the time)

**Reality**: Works best for creators with devoted niche audiences.

### Merchandise: The Inventory Nightmare

Ah, merch. Every creator's dream of seeing fans wear their brand:

- Print-on-demand means no inventory (Teespring, Printful, Redbubble)
- But profit margins are slim ($2-5 per shirt)
- You need distinctive designs people actually want to wear
- Shipping costs kill international sales
- Returns and quality issues damage your reputation
- Fans might buy one shirt... once

**The math**: If you sell 100 shirts/month at $5 profit each, that's $500. Most creators sell maybe 10.

**Reality**: Unless you're a lifestyle brand or have rabid fans, merch is more about brand building than revenue. It's cool seeing someone wear your logo, but don't quit your day job.

### Platform-Specific Programs

Every platform has their thing:

- **Instagram**: Reels Play Bonus (discontinued in most regions)
- **Twitter/X**: Super Follows, Twitter Blue revenue sharing
- **Twitch**: Bits, subs, ads (but Twitch takes 50%!)
- **LinkedIn**: Creator Accelerator Program (limited access)
- **Pinterest**: Creator Fund (very limited)

**Reality**: These come and go. Never rely on platform-specific programs.

### The Bottom Line

Here's what actually works:

1. **Diversify** – Never rely on one income stream
2. **Build relationships** – Your audience is everything
3. **Provide value** – Money follows value, not views
4. **Be patient** – This takes years, not months
5. **Track everything** – Know your numbers
6. **Stay authentic** – Selling out kills careers

Most successful creators combine multiple streams:

- Small YouTube ad revenue
- Occasional sponsorships
- Their own products/services
- Maybe some affiliate income
- Speaking gigs or consulting

The real money isn't in any single platform or program – it's in building a brand that transcends platforms. And honestly? Most of us won't get there, and that's okay. Create because you love it, and treat any money as a bonus.
