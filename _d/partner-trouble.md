## Act With Love

### Bad relationship? Two choices

- 1. Divorce - Sounds good, but excellent chance you'll end up in the same spot in your next relationship.
- 2. Stay - Two Choices
  - 2.a Stay and suffer in silence.
  - 2.b Try to make it better. Two Outcomes
    - 2.b.1 - Your partner reciprocates, your relationship improves.
    - 2.b.2 - Your partner doesn't, you get a divorce, but now you'll have many more useful skills.

### Drain - What's killing your relationship

The things that are killing your relationship:

- D - Distance, being apart, physically and emotionally.
- R - Reactivity. Really, being triggered.
- A - Avoidance. Trying not to think about it, often through escape.
- I - Inside your head. Really ruminating on what is wrong, what was wasted, etc.
- N - Not living your values.
  - N.1) Being a doormat/Being in a Lose/Win.
  - N.2) Not being the partner you know you can be.

### Being Assertive

#### Assertion vs Aggression

#### Declining Requests and setting boundaries

The two problems:

- Those who struggle to decline requests
- Those who struggle to decline requests while being fair and considerate.
- See [essentialim](/essentialism) for lots of ways to say no kindly.

Regardless, you need to have boundaries

| **Boundary Type**  | **What to Say**                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Time**           | "I'm happy to keep watching this show for another half hour, but then I'm going to bed."                                                         |
| **Space**          | "Please leave me alone; I have to get this task completed for work."                                                                             |
| **Social**         | "I can't go to the movies with you on Saturday. I've arranged to go out with my friends."                                                        |
| **Physical**       | "Please don't touch me like that. I don't like it."                                                                                              |
| **Conversational** | "I'd prefer not to talk about this right now. I'm tired, and I just want to chill. Can we talk about this tomorrow, after dinner?"               |
| **Mental**         | "Clearly, we have very different opinions about this. And your opinion is valid, but please don't try to force it on me. Let's agree to differ." |

#### Advanced Assertions Skills

**Advanced Skills**

| **Skill**                 | **Description**                                                                                               | **Example**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Empathic Assertion**    | Acknowledges the other person's feelings before making or declining a request.                                | "I realize this must be disappointing for you. However, I'm going to say no because I just can't find time right now." <br> "I totally get that you don't like this way of doing things. And I'd appreciate it if you'd work with me on this, even though you have reservations." |
| **Fogging**               | A way to respond to harsh criticism by finding a small grain of truth without arguing or getting defensive.   | "Yes, there are times when I don't follow through." <br> "Yes, I was late on this occasion, and I can see how frustrating that is for you."                                                                                                                                       |
| **Broken Record**         | Calmly repeating an assertive statement until the other person takes notice, without escalating the conflict. | "I don't want a drink. I want to go home." <br> "No thanks. It's late, and I'd like to go home."                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Combination Approach**  | Mixing empathy, fogging, and the broken record technique to handle repeated pushback.                         | "I get that you intend these comments as jokes - however, I don't experience them as funny, I find them hurtful." <br> "Yes, there are times when I don't have much of a sense of humor, it's true. But I find those comments hurtful."                                           |
| **Discrepancy Assertion** | Pointing out a gap between an agreement and reality, then making an assertive request.                        | "We agreed you'd be home by 6pm, but you've been arriving after 7pm. Can we discuss this?" <br> "We agreed that you'd take care of the dishes, but for the past few days, they've been left in the sink. Can we find a way to stick to our agreement?"                            |
| **Consequence Assertion** | A last-resort approach where consequences are clearly stated if the other person continues their behavior.    | "If you continue doing this, then I'll have to issue a formal warning." <br> "I've asked you multiple times to stop ABC. If it happens again, I will have to take XYZ action."                                                                                                    |

## Love Languages

The way you want to be loved. Annoyingly, excellent chance your love language doesn't match your partner's. Even worse, you'll be confused because you think you're doing things that are worth a lot in your love language, but worthless in theirs. Ugh.

- H - Hugs! Physical Touch.
- E - Terms of Endearment. Saying I love you, leaving notes of affirmation of their importance.
- A - Acts of Service. Take out the recycling, do the dishes.
- R - Receiving Gifts. It's not the size/price that matters; it's the thought. Classics: flowers and chocolates.
- T - Quality Time together.

ps. (My love languages are physical touch and quality time.)

## Random Topics

### Transitions

A common challenge in relationships is when a woman goes back to work when the kids are grown up.

### Kids: Are you doing the math right on shared interests?

{% include alert.html type="info" title="Personal Reflection" content="This sounds obvious, but it didn't occur to me till my oldest kid was 15 - bonkers!?" %}

Partners always bemoan growing apart and no longer having shared interests. "We used to love hiking together," they say. "We both enjoyed cooking." "We don't have anything in common anymore."

**But they overlook the biggest shared interest of all.**

Ask any parent what they care about most? Regardless of their stated preference, I assure their revealed preference is their children. Reminiscing over old photos, bragging to anyone who will listen, or most glorious of all getting to spend time with them when they're engaging with you.

_For more on [stated vs revealed preferences](/product#stated-vs-revealed-preferences), see the product management concepts._

**Your kids become your biggest shared interest**. Think about it - who else will value them as much as you do? Who else will celebrate their first steps, worry about their struggles, beam with pride at their achievements?

**This bond deepens exponentially over time:**

- As your children become more important to you both
- When grandchildren arrive and the cycle continues
- Through decades of shared experiences, memories, and stories
- As you witness each other's parenting journey and growth

**So yeah, dumb ass, you definitely share a very large shared interest**

### Love is a Verb, Not a Noun/Emotion

Love is not an emotion/noun; it's a **verb**, a verb meaning **act of service**.

**A conversation with Stephen Covey:**

**Man:** "My wife and I just don't have the same feelings for each other we used to have. I guess I just don't love her anymore and she doesn't love me. What can I do?"

**Covey:** "The feeling isn't there anymore?"

**Man:** "That's right. And we have three children we're really concerned about. What do you suggest?"

**Covey:** "Love her."

**Man:** "I told you, the feeling just isn't there anymore."

**Covey:** "Love her."

**Man:** "You don't understand. The feeling of love just isn't there."

**Covey:** "Then love her. If the feeling isn't there, that's a good reason to love her."

**Man:** "But how do you love when you don't love?"

**Covey:** "My friend, love is a verb. Love - the feeling - is a fruit of love, the verb. So love her. Serve her. Sacrifice. Listen to her. Empathize. Appreciate. Affirm her. Are you willing to do that?"

**Love is the fruit of the plant of service.**
