Useful writing tells people (including, possibly most importantly you) something true and important that they didn't already know in a way that leaves no doubt. And Everyone is different. So how to do both?

- Into the physical world: When AI has cameras:
- Into the emotional world

## Downside of hyper personalization

### We want shared experiences

- There is something wonderful about everyone knowing the same thing.
- Like when someone gives you a quote from a movie that you know and enjoy.

### Choice Paralysis
