I should have written up a plan before this [time off](/time-off) so I'd have been more deliberate. As it stands, I did what I wanted, got a tonne done, but missed some things that bring me a lot of energy.

## Moments and success stories

- See [family blog](/ig66/591)

## Success Stories

- Leveled up my tech, testing, and web-tech

## Top Learnings

- Pre-write vacation plans to get what I want out of them.
- If I don't force my self to maintain my habits, and stay balanced - I won't (I did zero magic).
- My habits are energizing, the time spent is still energy positive.
- Get my todo items checked off early instead of letting them drag (I could have got my hot tub working early too)
- Family time feels fantastic
- Make sure to do magic
- Make sure to do hot tub

## Relationships

### Friends

- ☑ Catch up with Greg

### Tori

Private

### Zach

- ☑ Get him programming
- ☑ Watch a movie

### Amelia

- ☑ Take her roller skating
- ☑ Watching her develop her social skills.

## Identity Health

### Magic

Sigh, I did zero magic. Not because I was doing mindless stuff, but because I was sucked into the tech.

### Tech Guru

Tech wise, I got a [tonne done](https://github.com/idvorkin/idvorkin.github.io/compare/master@%7B2021-11-19%7D...master@%7B2021-11-29%7D) (though I probably spent too much time, and started about a week before thanksgiving).

#### Shell + Enabling Environment + Python in VIM

- ☑ Explored containers, and see myself switching to them shortly
- ☐ Started using containers full time

#### Data Analysis - Pandas

Nope.

#### CUT: Ranking Systems

Nope.

#### Blog tech

- Ported blog [to typescript](https://github.com/idvorkin/idvorkin.github.io/commit/81663832722fc49ba43f4162194f92d713df822d#diff-b55cdbef4907b7045f32cc5360d48d262cca5f94062e353089f189f4460039e0)
- Figured out [E2E testing](https://dashboard.cypress.io/projects/s7659o/runs).
- Figured out code coverage
- Got python working in the browser using [Brython](/brython).
- Created a twine like language for Zach to port his games to e.g. [Steve's Jungle And Bar](/snjb). This system can run both in the console and in Brython, which is super fun!
- Updated blog sitenav to use font-awesome icons instead of text. Understood Bootstrap/CSS enough to make it pretty.
- Linked blog to GitHub edit page, and using [GitHub issues to track work items](https://github.com/idvorkin/idvorkin.github.io/issues/16)
- Updated to latest Algolia Search, and Bootstrap 5. And now I understand enough to be doing it efficiently.
- Created picture in excalidraw of how the blog works.
- Got and wrote up a [malware attack](/adblocker-trojan)
- Got sunburst graphs working, which will be the basis of my choose your own adventure random todo, and reflection, system

## Cognitive Health

- ☑ Wrote up a [tech blog post on malware](/adblocker-trojan)
- ☑ Started being more deliberate on blog work via GitHub issues, and E2E testing.
- ☑ Built thing I enjoy prompter

## Emotional Health

- ☑ Set a very simple todo list, and got it done (though at the last day).

### Meditation

Meditated once, but otherwise let this slide

### 750 words

Started doing this on a e-book handwriting again, spotty 2/10 days.

## Physical Health

Had big plans, but my trainer was out, then I got sick, and my PT was out. Here's hoping a run on Tuesday!

### Statistics

Weight: 225
Gym Days: 0

### Diet

My diet discipline has been weak. But had food poisoning and super puked on Friday, so didn't eat much through the weekend.

### Sleep

A few days at 4:30, lots of sleeping in.

### Energy

- Lot of undirected tech energy.

## House and goods

## Mental quicksand

### Hot tub

My hot tub lid got sort of deflated, which then pooled a tonne of water on top, which then made it unusable, and a huge mental weight. Finally got that taken care of on Sunday at 7pm, too late to use it, but early enough to have my holiday be a success.
