Imagine a weight tied around your body, imagine it dragging behind you, slowing down your motions, preventing you from going where you want to go. Imagine never taking it off, and getting no relief regardless of when you sit or sleep. Now imagine that's not a physical weight, but instead a mental weight, a psychic weight if you will. Psychic weight are the thoughts that prevent your mind and emotions from being fluid and light.

## Types of psychic weight

### Aversion and the resistance

Aversion is the desire to not face something. This often results in procrastination, and in extreme cases [addiction](/addiction). When left too long aversion can result in [shame](/shame), and paradoxically the thing that you refuse to face, can often be tackled, and once tackled feels invigorating.

Personifying emotions can be helpful, and aversion (and procrastination) are personified by [the resistance](/resistance).

### [Mind monsters](/mind-monsters)

Say you have a prize horse that you're training to win the Kentucky derby. Do you feed this horse ketchup and peanut butter? Of course not - you need this horse to win so you feed it the highest quality oats you can find. Now, isn't your mind far more important than a race horse? Surely you shouldn't be focusing on silly things like anger and ego, these unhelpful thoughts are mind monsters. Make sure there are no mind monsters in your [Idle Loop](/idle-loop)

### Triggers

Like the trigger on a land mine, we have thoughts that have caused us damage and emotional scarring. These thoughts are triggers, and when they happen we have an "unrealistic" response to them.

Analogies:

- Land mines
- RSI
- Aggravated sports injury

### Open decisions

### Open loops

### Shame

### Pride

{%include summarize-page.html src="/pride" %}

### Ruminating a parasitic idle loop

{%include summarize-page.html src="/idle-loop" %}

### Beating yourself up

### Grasping

The desire to not lose something - make less money, have someone die. The antidote here is realizing that everything is impermanent, in fact you will [die](/death) at which point you can keep nothing.

From the prophet:

- _For what are your possessions but things you keep and guard for fear you may need them tomorrow?_
- _And tomorrow, what shall tomorrow bring to the over-prudent dog burying bones in the trackless sand as he follows the pilgrims to the holy city?_
- _And what is fear of need but need itself?_
- _Is not dread of thirst when your well is full, the thirst that is unquenchable?_

## Antidotes

### Separate [pain from suffering](/mental-pain)

### Eat the frog

{%include summarize-page.html src="/frog" %}

### Getting things done

{%include summarize-page.html src="/gtd" %}

### CI/CC (Circle of Influence, Circle of Concern)

### Talk it through

### Meditation

{%include summarize-page.html src="/siy" %}

### This too shall pass

### Emotional First Aid

## Examples from my own life

### Bathroom remodel feeling "f@#\$" over

During our bathroom remodel, I felt the contractor was trying to f#\$ us over, and I got incredibly worked up, I couldn't sleep for multiple days. Ultimately, the contractor corrected the work, but me getting worked up, just made me a mess.

### Insecurity around money

I used to be very insecure about money, I couldn't buy a 1/2 gallon of milk because it was more expensive per ounce than buying a gallon of milk. And don't worry, this was happening well into the time I was buying $100 on my bar tabs.

### Needing to finish a self evaluation

### Needing to finish a document at work

### Small things that got really big

If you don't do small things, they get bigger and bigger and bigger.

### Examples of [Pride](/pride)

## Useful thoughts.

- As usual, the [7 habits](/7-habits) helps.
- [Habits](/habits) keep psychic weight handled.
- [Grandmother mind](/grandmother)
