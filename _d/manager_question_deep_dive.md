## What does a manager do

### How do you measure your success?

Success of my team: - People love their team. - People have clear understanding of career growth/progression and how their work supports it.

Inputs and Outputs:

4 Dimensions:

- Business Results: Ultimately the team delivers business value for our customers and organization.
- People Growing in a high performance team: The team is well gelled with team members helping each other. Everyone has growth plans which fit their needs and they are execution them.
- Engineering Efficiency and Process: Our engineering systems ensure a pit of success where things which can be automated have been, and we have high velocity releases with minimal risk.
- Technical Assets: Are systems are extensible in the ways that support the business. Our operational burden is minimal (side bar: to help me prioritize I'm on the pages), and our technical debt is applied judiciously (like take debt if you might be able to write off the asset)

### How do you describe your job to people outside the industry?

I run a factory which produces widgets and has employees. For those in the industry this translates to:

- Widget == Business Results
- Factory Workers == Team health and growing, leaders who make software
- Factory and Operating procedures == Software Design LifeCycle, Architecture, Tech Assets

My role:

- I work with the business to help figure out the best "widgets we can make", by understanding what people want to buy, and explaining how our factory runs.
- I Am Responsible the workers in the factory, are they healthy, learning, wanting to come to work every day, getting along with co-workers.
- I'm also responsible for the efficiency of the factory. Is production good and improving, Can the factory re-tool quickly. Have we built the right scaffolding in the factory to easily change the kinds of widgets we make.

Top metrics:

- Did we make the right widgets on time and budget
- Are the works happy based on surveys
- Is our factory solid and able to make new stuff quickly and maintain production.

### How do you build a team?

In the ideal world:

- Start with a high level view of the business
- Put in places the senior developers to build out the architecture and process
- Start working by getting your SDE-IIs and SDE-Is

In the real world:

- Vague Idea
- Add people as you find them (however, hard stop when too many juniors)
- Pick some easy wins, and get those started, ready to pick up debt to see what we can do.
- As you wait to hire more experienced folks try to borrow folks from other teams ideally for a rotation or at least for bar raising designs, architecture and mentorship

### Why is management attractive to you?

- On deathbed, the product I want is people who grew
  - Cliche: Love your people, want to see them thrive and grow
  - Want to save folks from unsustainable, and treat folks as people
- Get shit done
  - Clear roadblocks
  - Ship
- Skill, clarifying, building concensous, sharing the story and meaning.
- Leader Ownership, but not a good enough PM, and very strong tech
- Lead and inspire
- Servant leadership
- On top of best practices

### What in your mind are the responsibilities of a manager?

### What specific types of duties would you like to do help with at this company?

## Managing and Developering People

### How do you keep people motivated?

- Autonomy
  - You are the owner
  - All decision need your sign off
  - Coach from behind (here's success, here's how I'd say it, what are the consequences, misses)
  - Know team has your back.
  - Protecting from harmful rays of upper management and business
  - Only clear out as much as required
- Mastery
  - Training
  - Bigger and Bigger Opportunities
  - Bigger and bigger exposure
- Purpose
  - Focus on the why
  - Call out the impact
  - Share the success with the team
  - Share suceess with partners and boss
- Coaching + Career Growth
  - Catching people doing things right.
  - 110% of capability but clarify doing 110% vs 80%

### What is the point of a 1:1?

I produce nothing, my output is the output of the team, and the team is the sum of the people. My ability to get the most value from my people is through my relationship with the people. If they trust me whole heartidly, they'll tell me stuff I need to know, and I'll be able to understand how best to use them/influence them/inspire them. So, all my 1:1's start with What's on your mind - what ever they have we talk through. based on time and place we'll do X, Y.

For 1:1's for my team, the employees owns the Agenda, however I will nudge them. I like to spend time

- Building relationships
- Providing Larger Context
- Having confidential discussions on concerns and questions.
- Coaching strategically
- Coaching tactically.

I also have some special 1:1s:

- Leadership card evaluation exercise
- Career discussions - A discussion around what we should be focused on for the next 6-18 months.
- Reviewing role guidelines - to help ensure we're on the same page about tactical gaps.

### How do you identify engineers who could make good managers? How do you help them develop?

### How do you handle a great engineer with communication problems?

- High Order: Goal is not "communication style", but ability to influence.

- Types of communication problems
  - Clarity of thought
    - Big gap - but doesn't sound like the criteria
  - Not listening to others
  - ESL -
  - Written
  - Verbal
    - Toast masters
    - Pre-write thoughts
    - Use pictures
    - Say not great on my feet
  - Slow in situations

### How do you handle someone who really wants a promotion but isn't ready?

- Surprises are **BAD**:

  - Haven't set clear expectations.
  - Requires mini RCA

- Goal:

  - Engineer comes to conclusion himself
  - Engineers feels on track
  - Engineer aspires to get to that level
  - Engineer doesn't want to be overlevelled
  - Engineer is self aware
  - Engineer gets new opportunities/support required.

- Start w assume engineer right - lets look at the criteria together.

  - Now or next 1:1?

- Review role guidelines

  - Ask for self evaluation
  - Go over with examples together
  - Ask "How would you describe your behavior vs someone elses"
  - Ask what gaps do you see

- Call out positive examples from engineers @ Level + 1

### What do you do when a team completely disagrees with the founder/VP on the direction of a product?

## Business Accumen

### Discuss this companies trajectory as you see it. What choices do they think they're good and bad at? Would you have done things differently? What problems do you see coming up in the future?

**Zillow:**

**Facebook:**

**Google:**

**Amazon:**

**Microsoft:**

**Linked In**

## Self Assessment

### Think of a mistake or failure you’ve made in the past two years. What did you learn from it and/or do differently in the future?

### What would a report/peer/manager feedback on you be? Strengths, areas for development, etc.

### How would you assess if someone is a good manager?

Using the same metrics I apply to myself. For the how I'd:

- Look at "employee surveys"
- Look at their business results (scorecards and KPIs)
- Look at their operational load and tickets/pages/etc
- Interview their employees, PMs, and business partners, and partner teams
- Ask them about their architecture
- Ask them the interview questions

## Process and Mechanism

### What kind of process have you followed in the past and what has worked well for you?

### What process hasn't worked?

### How do you institute the right process at the right time? How do you know when you need something more formal?

### Have they ever removed process? Why or why not?

## Hiring

### What are you looking for in an engineer when you recruit?

#### Do they prefer to hire only experienced folks?

I need a pipeline of developers for mentorship, fan out and succession planning.

Need a Principal per 30 people.
Ratio Senior: SDE-II: SDE-I (1,2,2) => ten person team: 2, 4, 4.

Everyone grows by learning and teaching. Lots of rules
A crappy job for SDE-K is a growth opportunity for SDE-(K-1)
SDE-IIIs want to think hard and lead
SDE-I bring energy and excitment, but still dependant.
SDE-IIs do the bulk of the work.

Ideally, people grow from SDE-I -> SDE-III on a team, so much knowledge transfer and opportunity.

### Are they more comfortable with generalists or specialists?

Generalists - 99% of time

1. Industry changes to much.
2. Mostly about Architecture/Design and SDL and coding, domain and language easy to learn.

Specialist - 1% on very specific teams.

1. File system
2. Distributed system transaction processing.
3. Firmware engineers

Want full stack teams:

FE -> Learn the customer empathy through user interactions
BE -> Learn the tech chops of complex system.

### How have you optimized the recruiting process in the past? Have they thought about the recruiting funnel and how you can optimize different parts of it?

### What are their thoughts on structured interview loops vs. non-structured free-form loops?

## Firing

### How do you deal with people performance issues?

### Have you ever had to implement a PIP (performance improvement plan)? What are your thoughts on it?

Multiple:

- In general, if you're on PIP, you've been going home and feeling like shit, who wants to do that?

## Random topics

### Should industry have architects

- Best discussion on the topic [Tech Lead vs Architect](/software-leadership-roles)
- Physical world vs Software:
  - Structural Engineer
    - MSFT Software Archtiect
    - Though shall not pass.
    - Enforce "Building Code" - Beam must be 1 foot thick. No variance, no pass. Built for the average.
  - Physical Architect == Convert Customer Desire (Product Owner) into a maintable buildable system (tech lead, engineering manger).
    - Should be owned by the team.
    - Knows the reality of the system better then Structural Engineer.
- The gaps - inexperienced, (or lazy) teams
  - You give the rope, but the team is accountable (hard w/rotation)
  - Design reviews
- Good use of "Architects"
  - Guidance - not sign off.
  - Technology SME's for advice.
  - Long term vision and industry understanding.
  - Consult on large projects.
  - Mentoring of senior (not PE) employees
- Covered by great TPMs, drive large scale company changes.

### How do you bootstrap technical leadership in an organization that has no public titles?

### What are the pros/cons of public vs. private titles?
