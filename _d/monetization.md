## The Advertising Landscape

Advertising is a $155 billion business in the USA. Of that, $85B is digital and $70B is TV (with digital platforms investing heavily in video to capture TV spend).

### Why Brands Advertise

A brand is the perception that lives in customers' minds. Since many products are fungible, advertising serves two critical purposes:

1. **Discovery** - Making customers think of your brand
2. **Preference** - Convincing customers your brand is best

The key metric is Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) vs Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV). As long as CLTV > CAC, it's worth spending on advertising.

### How Much Do Companies Spend?

Top US advertisers spend billions annually:

| Brand          | Annual Ad Spend |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Facebook       | $10B            |
| Comcast        | $5.75B          |
| Amazon         | $3.38B          |
| General Motors | $3.25B          |

### Advertising Spend by Industry

Companies spend varying percentages of gross revenue on advertising:

| Industry          | % of Revenue |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| Consumer Products | 24%          |
| Consumer Services | 15%          |
| Tech              | 15%          |
| Education         | 11%          |
| Banking           | 8%           |

### How Much Do Ad Platforms Make?

In 2019, major ad platforms generated:

| Company  | Revenue |
| -------- | ------- |
| Google   | $162B   |
| Facebook | $71B    |
| YouTube  | $15B    |
| Amazon   | $14B    |

## Key Advertising Terms

### Performance vs Display

- **Performance Advertising**: Pay for action (clicks). Direct marketing approach using Cost Per Click (CPC).
- **Display Advertising**: Pay for impressions. Brand marketing using CPM (Cost Per Thousand impressions).

### CPM and CPC

- **CPM**: Cost per thousand views/impressions
- **eCPM**: Effective CPM (accounts for viewability)
- **CPC**: Cost per click

### ROAS and CTR

- **ROAS**: Return on Ad Spend (Sales รท Campaign Price)
- **CTR**: Click-through rate (Clicks รท Impressions)

### Ad Inventory and Supply

- **Ad Supply**: Number of eyeballs on your site
- **Ad Inventory**: Sellable impressions (ad load ร ad supply)

Creators generate ad inventory; platforms sell it by matching with advertisers.

## Creator Monetization Models

### The Hard Truth

Before diving into specifics: **99% of creators make less than $100/month**. The top 1% make all the money, and even they hustle harder than you'd believe. Do this because you love it, not for the money.

### Ad Revenue Sharing

YouTube gives creators ~$7.50 per 1,000 views. A viral million-view video earns about $7,500, but:

- You need 1,000 subscribers AND 4,000 watch hours to qualify
- Most creators make $1-3 per 1,000 views
- YouTube takes 45% of ad revenue
- Most videos get under 1K views

### Affiliate Marketing

Creators earn commissions by promoting products. Square Space might pay per signup, while Amazon's rates vary by category (1-4% for most, with electronics at just 1%).

**The Amazon Associates Catch-22**:

- Need 3 qualifying sales in 180 days to keep your account
- Without API access (which requires 3 sales), you only get ugly text links
- Cookie duration is only 24 hours
- Commission rates are pathetic

### Brand Sponsorships

This is where real money exists:

- Rates: $20-100+ per 1,000 followers
- Requires media kits, rate cards, contracts
- FTC requires disclosure (#ad)
- One bad sponsorship can tank credibility

### Direct Fan Support

**Patreon/Memberships**:

- Predictable monthly income
- Platform fees: 5-12%
- Payment processing: 2.9% + $0.30
- High churn rates

**Tips and Donations**:

- Direct support from viewers
- Highly variable income

### Digital Products

Courses, presets, templates, ebooks offer high profit margins (near 100%), but:

- Requires expertise people will pay for
- Time-intensive to create quality products
- Ongoing customer support
- Refunds and chargebacks

### Merchandise

Print-on-demand eliminates inventory, but:

- Slim margins ($2-5 per shirt)
- Shipping costs kill international sales
- Most creators sell maybe 10 items/month

## Platform-Specific Monetization

### YouTube: The Long Game

Requirements:

- 1,000 subscribers
- 4,000 watch hours
- Advertiser-friendly content

Reality: A 100K-view video might earn $100-300.

### TikTok Creator Fund: Pennies for Views

- Pay rate: $0.02-0.04 per 1,000 views
- 1M views = maybe $20-40
- Best for audience building, not direct monetization

### Amazon Associates: The Classic Disappointment

Pro tip for those 3 qualifying sales:

{% include amazon.html asin="B0006BB9MG;B0050R67U0;B0737N6LWX" %}

- **Velcro Cable Ties** ($5.99) - Everyone needs cable management
- **MagicFiber Cleaning Cloths** (~$5) - Perfect for screens
- **Reynolds Slow Cooker Liners** ($5.75) - Makes cleanup easy

### Snapchat's Novel Ad Products

Snapchat faced a unique challenge - as a camera company, they had no obvious place for ads. Their solution:

1. **Sponsored Lenses**: AR filters in geofenced areas
2. **Sponsored Stories**: Brand content in the Stories feed

This case study shows how platforms must innovate to create ad inventory.

## The Bottom Line

Successful monetization requires:

1. **Diversification** - Never rely on one income stream
2. **Value First** - Money follows value, not views
3. **Patience** - Success takes years, not months
4. **Authenticity** - Selling out kills careers
5. **Data Tracking** - Know your numbers

Most successful creators combine:

- Small ad revenue
- Occasional sponsorships
- Their own products/services
- Some affiliate income
- Speaking/consulting gigs

The real money isn't in any single platform - it's in building a brand that transcends platforms. Create because you love it, and treat any money as a bonus.
