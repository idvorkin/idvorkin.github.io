Waiting in line at the grocery store, sitting in an Uber, pooping - in these invisible times, we execute our idle loop. We spend a lot of time in our idle loop, and it can either increase our energy or drain it. By being aware of and then modifiying how we spend our idle loop we can improve our lives one poop at a time.

## Why: Parasitic energy drain or regenerative braking

### The first responder: boredom

With nothing to do, we experience the often phantom, [mental pain](/mental-pain) of boredom. If we aren't [proactive](/7h-c1), we resolve this via distracting parasitic loops. Parasitic loops take no energy, and are even occasionally satisfying, but they're a double wammy negative:

- Parasitic loops prevents us from working on our positive regenerative loops.
- Parasitic loops likely erodes our pursuit of happiness, by blocking our inner peace, passion and compassion.

This is very similar to the often phantom, physical pain of hunger. If we aren't proactive, we'll resolve it with junk food which has the physical double wammy.

- Junk food prevents us from eating healthy food
- Junk food erodes our health and diet.

## Regenerative loops

### Positive thinking

### Reading something nurturing

I have seen two categories 1) self help books, but they can be too charging up, or good content- the [Very Short Introductions](https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/v/very-short-introductions-vsi/) series has been superb.

### Gratefulness thinking
