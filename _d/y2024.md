I like to begin in mind, so let's write a report for 2024. This hasn't happened, but if I don't write it out and focus on it, it certainly won't.

### Major Projects

#### Finish and Present What I wish I knew at 42

{%include summarize-page.html src="/42" %}

#### "Publish" EM Handbook: be the EM everyone wants

#### Work on my bestie/simulator/smilebox

{%include summarize-page.html src="/ai-bestie" %}

### August Vacation

This summer I'll have 5 weeks off (maybe 6), and I'd like to spend them wisely. I was thinking I'd do 1 week with each kid independently and then spend 3 weeks with the family. Sounds like a blast.

(I guess when I'm driving, I'll need to bring some 32 KG Kettlebells with me)

**Week with Zach**

**Week with Amelia**

**The whole family**

### Goals

#### Physical Health

| Metric     | Goal                  | Jan               | Status                   |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Weight     | 165                   | 195               | -                        |
| Sleep      | 9pm - 5am             | 9pm-5am           | -                        |
| Gym        | 5d/week               | 6d/week           | -                        |
| Swings     | 2H: 6x32, 1H:6x32     | 2H: 3x32; 1H:2x24 | -                        |
| TGU        | 5x32                  | 4x32              | -                        |

| L-Sit      | 60s                   | 10s               | Not started              |
| Half Lotus | 300s from cold        | 30s sets          | Lots of warm up required |

Other things to get into:

- Skipping Rope
- Pistol Squats (training)
- Pull ups (I do hangs so far)

#### Emotional Health

| Metric        | Goal     | Jan      | Status              |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| Meditation    | Dialy    | 3x week  | Inconsistent        |
| Box Breathing | 15s/side | 10s/side | Sometimes can do 12 |
| Journalling   | Dialy    | 3x week  | Inconsistent        |
| Gratefulness  | Dialy    | 3x week  | Inconsistent        |

Meditation:

- I probalby need more rituals around this.
- SKY Breathing is my most complex and longest 24m + 10m, feels good too.
- Box breathing. I like to do this all the time, great in the car, 12s/side.

Get through calibrations with out suffering (but pain is probably rightly required). And my [current approach](https://idvorkin.azurewebsites.net/manager-book/performance-reveiws-calibrations-psc-olr-connections).

#### Magic

Magic used to be a huge part of my life, but after a nasty injury in 2022 it faded in 2023. 24 is the year I want to get it back. It's not about "knowing magic", or "practicing magic", it's about sharing magic with random strangers and friends

#### Identity Health

Biking and ballooning are the two I can think of. Lets make 'em happen

### Books I plan to read

**Outlive** (to start)

Peter Attia's book that goes into the e

**How to write a book** (in progress)

{%include summarize-page.html src="/write-book" %}

Dogs of war and Bear head

Interesting scifi series about using genetic engineering instead of robots for soldiers. As it's harder to "hack them". Book 2 gets much more interseting.
