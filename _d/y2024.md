I like to begin in mind, so let's write a report for 2024. This hasn't happened, but if I don't write it out and focus on it, it certainly won't.

(**Update EOY** _What a year! The highlights: An incredible 6-week summer vacation with the family, huge progress in AI (especially [CHOP and CHOW](/chop)), consistent 5am gym sessions, and ending the year strong with daily meditation and journaling. Some areas need more work (weight, magic, biking), but overall a year of growth and learning._)

### Major Projects

#### Finish and Present What I wish I knew at 42

(**Update EOY** _Not a lot of progress here, but got better at being 46! Moving to 2025!_)

{%include summarize-page.html src="/42" %}

#### "Publish" EM Handbook: be the EM everyone wants

(**Update EOY** _Didn't publish it, but got lots of content [updates](https://gist.github.com/idvorkin/032c74d8ba41ad1e12b7af9c94b89f57#file-z_gpt-4o-2024-11-20-md) In 2025 I'll think about making some TikTok's out of it_)

{%include summarize-page.html src="/manager-book" %}

{%include summarize-page.html src="/write-book" %}

#### Work on my bestie/simulator/smilebox

(**Update EOY** _OH, spent a tonne of time on this. This year was the year of AI, and the end of the year [CHOP and CHOW](/chop), and worked on [Tony](https://github.com/idvorkin/tony_tesla), heck I even wrote a [TUI tool](https://github.com/idvorkin/vapi-call-viewer) for better debugging him._)

{%include summarize-page.html src="/ai-bestie" %}

### August Vacation

(**Update EOY** _It was AWESOME! Had a fantastic time with each kid individually, and some great family time. Highlights included SF with Zach, beach time with the family, and collecting lighthouse stamps all over WA!_)

{%include summarize-page.html src="/time-off-2024-08" %}

### Goals

#### Physical Health

(**Update EOY** _Mixed results - great consistency with early rising and gym, made progress on weight but not to goal. Some goals like running and flexibility work got deprioritized._)

Other things to get into:

- Skipping Rope

#### Emotional Health

(**Update EOY** _Mixed year overall, but finished strong! The last two weeks of 2024 I hit all my daily practices consistently - a great foundation for 2025._)

| Metric        | Goal     | Jan      | Dec          | Status          |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Meditation    | Daily    | 3x week  | Inconsistent | Inconsistent    |
| Box Breathing | 15s/side | 10s/side | 12s/side     | Steady progress |
| Journalling   | Daily    | 3x week  | Inconsistent | Inconsistent    |
| Gratefulness  | Daily    | 3x week  | Inconsistent | Inconsistent    |

(**Update EOY** _Very inspired thanks to new technology in decemeber, check out_)
{%include summarize-page.html src="/process-journal" %}

Meditation:

- I probalby need more rituals around this.
- SKY Breathing is my most complex and longest 24m + 10m, feels good too.
- Box breathing. I like to do this all the time, great in the car, 12s/side.

Get through calibrations with out suffering (but pain is probably rightly required). And my [current approach](https://idvorkin.azurewebsites.net/manager-book/performance-reveiws-calibrations-psc-olr-connections).

(**Update EOY** _Made progress handling calibrations, but still dread them. Will continue working on this in 2025._)

{%include summarize-page.html src="/mental-pain" %}

#### Magic

(**Update EOY** _Not doing many tricks, however doing a solid job of practicing, I have the slieghts just need the mojo to perform them. Will try again in 2025!_)

Magic used to be a huge part of my life, but after a nasty injury in 2022 it faded in 2023. 24 is the year I want to get it back. It's not about "knowing magic", or "practicing magic", it's about sharing magic with random strangers and friends

#### Identity Health

(**Update EOY** _Did ballooning for a bit, but it faded. Biking really suffered thanks to the Tesla, maybe when it's sunny again I'll get back to it. Will try again in 2025!_)

Biking and ballooning are the two I can think of. Lets make 'em happen

### Books I plan to read

(**Update EOY** _Didn't really read much these year, next year I'm excited to see how we use AI's for reading_)

**Outlive** (to start)

Peter Attia's book that goes into the e
{%include summarize-page.html src="/last-year" %}

**How to write a book** (in progress)

{%include summarize-page.html src="/write-book" %}

Dogs of war and Bear head

Interesting scifi series about using genetic engineering instead of robots for soldiers. As it's harder to "hack them". Book 2 gets much more interseting.

### My Kettlebell Progress
