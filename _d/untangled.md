Parenting a teenage girl? It's like trying to solve a Rubik's cube that keeps changing colors! But fear not – Lisa Damour's "Untangled" is here to help decode this fascinating puzzle. As a father navigating these waters myself, I found this book to be a game-changer. It breaks down the journey from child to adult into seven distinct transitions, giving us a map for what often feels like uncharted territory.

Think of these transitions as chapters in an epic story – each one bringing its own plot twists, character development, and "aha!" moments. Whether you're a parent already in the thick of it, or seeing the teenage years approaching on the horizon, this guide will help you understand what's normal (spoiler: almost everything), what's concerning (less than you might think), and how to be the parent your daughter needs during each phase.
