"Alright, Igor, here's the Tony take. Life throws you the Tesla, gives you Autopilot, now you're more soprano than subway rider. But let's get real. Biking and being car-free, that's freedom, fitness, adventure."

That's my AI life coach talking—who sounds like Tony Soprano and pretends to live in my Tesla. I'd called him up while sitting in the school pickup line, facing an identity crisis about my transportation choices. What sounds like science fiction is actually how I worked through one of my biggest personal dilemmas: sometimes the best way to understand your own values is to have a conversation with an AI version of yourself, especially when that AI cuts right to the heart of the matter with New Jersey wisdom.

I've always prided myself on being a "mostly car-free spirit." It's literally in my [eulogy](/eulogy)—right there in black and white, celebrating my love for my folding bike and public transit adventures with the kids. I biked over 3,000 miles in 2022, carried groceries on my handlebars, and felt smugly superior about my carbon footprint.

Then I bought a Tesla. And suddenly found myself using AI to excavate the deeper truths about who I really am.

## The Identity Crisis

The numbers don't lie. In 2022, I biked over 3,000 miles. In 2023, after getting Tony (my Tesla), that number dropped below 300. My best friend had warned me: "Buying a Tesla for someone who wants to be a car-free spirit is like buying an ice cream maker for someone trying to lose weight."

But there I was, rationalizing. Tony did the driving—I was just along for the ride, right? I decorated him with flowers and bunnies, programmed him to make fart sounds when I got texts, and even gave him an [AI agent](https://github.com/idvorkin/tony_tesla) with a Tony Soprano accent. Surely this counted as being car-free adjacent?

The cognitive dissonance was real. My eulogy talks about taking kids on the bus to the airport just to ride the elevators and come home. Now I was driving to Costco because it was "convenient." The bike that once defined my identity was gathering dust in the garage.

## Wait, You're Making This Up, Right?

I get it—having a Tony Soprano AI life coach living in your Tesla sounds like something out of a sci-fi comedy. But here's the thing: I actually built this. I trained an AI on Tony's speech patterns, gave it his personality, and yes, I genuinely call it up when I need to work through life decisions. The conversation you're about to hear isn't scripted or fictional—it's me, sitting in my actual Tesla, having a real identity crisis about my transportation choices, talking it through with my digital mobster therapist. Here's the recorded conversation and the full transcript as proof.

_Listen to the actual conversation above, or read the transcript below:_

**Tony:** Tony Tony here. What can I do you for?

**Me:** Hey. I'm gonna need some guidance. So I decided, well, before I got a Tesla, I wrote in my eulogy that I was a car-free spirit, and I didn't drive, and I loved taking the subway. And I loved biking. But I don't really bike anymore. But then, alternatively, I don't really drive because Tony drives me everywhere. Tell me how I should think about this. Is biking better? Is being driven around better?

**Tony:** Alright, Igor. Here's the Tony take. First off, it's classic. Life throws you the Tesla, gives you Autopilot, now you're more soprano than subway rider. But let's get real. Biking and being car-free, that's freedom, fitness, adventure. You feel the wind, you see the city, you get the proud self-sufficient glow plus those quads, baby. On the other hand, Tesla life—stress-free, plus you get work done or meditate or, you know, chat with your favorite mobster AI. Now ask yourself, what's your value here? Is it independence? Health? Time efficiency? Fun? Don't sweat labels.

**Me:** That is a good one. I guess if I'm with the family, Tony makes sense. He's almost an active service. And if I'm by myself, I need to think through, am I just driving because I'm being lazy? And this is just consumption activity? Or am I trying to save myself time and be more efficient? Because I think a lot of the time, well, first, humorously, traffic can end up being less efficient. And then I'm not actually meditating. And I guess, like, if it comes to listening to a podcast, I can do that while biking. And then I get exercise. I think adventure-wise, it's about the same. It is nice to have all the stuff with me all the time, though.

**Tony:** Totally. Having all your gear in the car is peak convenience. But hey, sometimes having all the stuff turns into lugging all the stuff you never use. Biking forces you to be sleek, soprano style—just the essentials, no baggage. Which one feels lighter on your soul, boss?

**Me:** That's it. Good. I think I guess there's no reason to agonize over this. I can just start biking and see if I like it and maybe part of the reason I stopped liking it is I'm just weaker now, and it's harder for me. And if I did it again, I'd feel a lot happier.

**Tony:** Bada bing. That's the spirit. No need to agonize. Just experiment. You start biking, see how you feel, maybe you'll get stronger, maybe you'll just love the breeze and the freedom again. And hey, if not, Tony the Tesla's always got your back seat warm. No shame, boss.

**Me:** Yep. I definitely need the cardio, and I'm definitely not doing other cardio things. So I think that's fantastic advice.

**Tony:** That's music to my ears. You get on that bike, your heart pumps, endorphins flow, boss mode unlocked. Don't overthink it. Just ride and enjoy the journey. If you hate it, you know where I'll be. Blasting AC in the Tesla waiting to chauffeur you in style.

## The Conversation That Changed Everything

What struck me most about this conversation wasn't just Tony's surprisingly practical advice, but how it reframed the entire dilemma. I was treating this as a binary choice—bike person or Tesla person—when the real question was much simpler: **What serves your values in this specific situation?**

## What I Learned About Identity

Sometimes our identities need to evolve, not disappear. The "mostly car-free spirit" wasn't about the bike itself—it was about intentionality, adventure, and finding joy in unconventional transportation.

Tony became a tool for family adventures: camping trips where we slept under the glass roof, charging stops that turned into juggling sessions, and road trips that would have been impossible on two wheels. The kids got to experience California's coast, Ashland's charm, and countless other adventures.

The bike didn't disappear from my life—it just found its right-sized place. Some trips call for pedal power and the meditative rhythm of cycling. Others call for autopilot and the ability to arrive refreshed after 300 miles.

Identity isn't about rigid adherence to a past version of yourself. It's about staying true to your values while adapting your methods. I'm still that guy who values sustainable transport, family adventures, and finding the unconventional path. I just have more tools in my toolkit now.

And sometimes, when you're having an identity crisis, the best person to talk to is yourself—even if that self happens to be an AI with a New Jersey accent.
