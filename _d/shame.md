Shame and guilt are often confused emotions caused by self judgments that lead to contrasting behaviors. Shame drives people to hide or deny their wrongdoings while guilt, properly applied drives people to the correct behaviors. These are both examples of [mental-pain](/mental-pain) and when the pain is phantom or cronic, are often well served by [grandmother mind](/grandmother-mind).

| Emotion | Judgment                      | Accuracy Test                        | Alternate Emotion      |
| ------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Shame   | I am bad, I have been exposed | How as I exposed? Is that reasonable | emberassed             |
| Guilt   | I did something bad           | What was my intent                   | sad/regret for outcome |

- Unrealistic expectations cause failures
- Unmet commitments harden into failures
- Failure hardens into guilt.
- Guilt hardens into shame.
- Shame derives its power from being unspeakable.
- Shame reinforces itself through rumination.

Catalyst for shame: Secrecy, Silence, Judgment
Fixes for shame: Empathy and the tests

## The tests

### Shame - In what way was I exposed and is it something and does that make me inferior?

If the thing for which I was exposed was reasonable for me not to know, or for me not to have done, then I can be emerassed - I am human after all.

But I should not feel shame.

### Guilt - What was my intent from the act?

If my intent was good, and I did my best, I can have regret, or be sad - am human after all.

But I should not feel guilty.
