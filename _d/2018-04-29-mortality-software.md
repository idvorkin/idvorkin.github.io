In a poem

      Too many dreams, not enough sleep
      I want it all, though none is to keep

      The wanderer searches, near and far
      Everyone dreams for their north star

      It moves and  it gleams, so hungry and restless
      Where am I going? When will I live this?

In a Dr. Seuss Poem

    How did it get so late so soon?
    It’s night before it’s afternoon.

    December is here before it’s June.
    My goodness how the time has flewn.

    How did it get so late so soon?

## Why

### Why mortality software?

To be satisfied we need to live in accordance with the person we want to be. Mortality software helps you understand who you want to be, and supports you in being that person.

### How will it work?

Mortality software will be both forward and backwards facing. By this I mean it will help you plan what you need to do to achieve your eulogy, and also help evaluate how effectively you are achieving your goals. It will help you reflect, often helping you realize your initial eulogy requires change, or your behaviors require change.

#### Role and Value Finder, Eulogy Writer.

To figure out who you want to be, write your eulogy. To make it easier, figure out the roles in your life. Imagine the person who would speak to each role of your life during your funeral. What would you want each person to say? That eulogy is the person you want to be.

Now imagine how you'd want people to remember the way you acted, especially during ambiguity, challenges and crisis. Those behaviors are your values.

Your roles, how you balance your between them, and your values are the person you want to be, your north star.

Most people who have gone through the eulogy process have found it incredibly difficult. Morality software will make the eulogy process easier.

Many people find this hard to imagine, so here's as a simple example. The eulogy module can start by presenting you different people and their values. Based on how much those people and values resonate with you, mortality software can suggest values that might appeal to you.

## Appendix: Product Market Fit

### When is this most appropriate?

### What is similar to this?

Life coaches, positive pychiatry, worklife balance.

### Are there societal structures like this?

No, not really. As a society we don't really break up the "work till you retire" life stage. Maybe the closest is new years resolutions, and mid life crisis.

### Why doesn't this exist?

This software causes two things that people really don't like 1/ Thinking you've got [finite time](/death) 2/ Being Judged (and worst of all by you).

**Thinking you've got finit time**

Why people avoid it:

- It feels aweful, read [on being mortal](/death)

Mitigations

- Focusing on life stages.
- Reframing infinite life to compressed morbidity
- Focusing on satisfaction

**Judging yourself**

Why people avoid it:

Mitigations

- Be compassion driven
- Explain that by default, doesn't mean it's not happening.

## FAQ

### Why call it Time.Ltd

I initially named my future mortality software package Life.ltd, but that, while funny, was too negative. Instead of thinking our life is limited, we should think our time is limited, and thus we should make sure we are using it well. Thus, I renamed my future mortality software Time.Ltd.
