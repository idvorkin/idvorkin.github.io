I did my Bar Mitzvah at the Wailing Wall in Israel — the holiest place in Judaism. We flew there as a family, and I still remember stepping off the plane and feeling an intense warmth. I turned to my sister and whispered, "I can feel God." She rolled her eyes and said, "That's not God. That's forty degrees Celsius."

## My story

### How I Became a Man at 13

I grew up in a small town, with a conservative synagogue. Services were always in Hebrew — a language my dad didn’t know, and neither did I. But hearing the words week after week, we memorized the prayer songs by repetition. To me, the words were gobbledygook, but the melodies stuck.

Every Friday night we would walk to services. My dad didn’t believe in God, but he loved the synagogue. For him it wasn’t about belief; it was about community. Because the congregation was small, they often struggled to gather the ten men needed for certain prayers. Most weeks the phone would ring, and they’d ask him to come. We lived just five minutes away, so he always did.

When you’re Jewish, turning thirteen means becoming a man — you study the Torah and have a Bar Mitzvah. My grandparents had immigrated to Israel, so when it was my turn, we flew there. It was my first time on a plane. I had my Bar Mitzvah at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem, the most holy place in Judaism. Standing there, surrounded by history and prayer, made it unforgettable.

### When Proof Became My Religion

I am an engineer: science, cause and effect, proof. If you can’t measure it, model it, or test it, you don’t trust it. No proof, no belief. Stories without evidence - bugs in the system. Miracles? Not reproducible. God? No causal mechanism. The whole thing looked like bad engineering.

Why would I build my life on something that couldn’t even pass a basic test plan?

What I didn’t see then was that religion doesn’t live or die on proof — it lives in practice.

### The Day I valued Religion

Just a normal day at work, the phone rang out of the blue. “Igor, please sit down.” My dad was dead. I had no idea what to do, but my synagogue — basically the Jewish version of a church — did. In Judaism, the dead are buried quickly, usually within 24 hours, so there’s no time to get lost in indecision. You just follow the steps.

At the funeral, the rabbi put a tie around my neck, and cut it. Why did that feel important? Who knows, who cares — it just did. Then the congregation sang a song. Even though it was in Hebrew, gobbledygook to me, I remembered the melody from before. It was incredibly comforting, it was right. I just knew everyone was there, supporting me.

At the graveyard, when we were putting him into the ground, I could see the names of his friends from my Bar Mitzvah days on the gravestones beside him. I could picture him laughing with them, and knowing he was with his friends gave me a sense of peace.

Then came shiva, the seven days of mourning. A candle burned the whole time, a quiet reminder that life had paused. For a week, people came, prayed, sat with us. At the end, the candle went out, and the expectation was to begin stepping back into the world. Not to “move on,” but to take a step forward.

After that came shloshim, the thirty days of softer mourning, and later, yahrzeit, the annual prayer and candle to remember. These rituals stretched out across time, creating a rhythm of grief and remembrance.

What I valued most was the certainty of what to do. I didn’t have to ask, “Am I grieving right?” The protocol answered that. And being in community meant I wasn’t alone. Major life events stopped feeling like cruel surprises — I could see that others had walked this path before me.

That was the day religion showed its worth to me: not in metaphysics, but in structure and support when I needed them most.

### When someone important to me found god.

I won't list their name out of privacy, but in my deep respect for this person I had to really dig into god, I went to a few sermons live, and this person started reasding a daily devotional, and so did I.

Some observations I've had:

- There are many different religions, with deeply different beliefs
- Much of the interpretation is that of a self help book, instead of the classic format I'm used to "build a model and describe it", "several anecodote stories", "1 chapater per story", the bible stuff I'm exposed to starts with a really old verse, then has a bunch of interpretation.

## The Hard Parts for Me

### Proof

The problem is proof. I don’t see it. With an engineering mindset, I expect cause, effect, and data — and religion doesn’t give me that. The parts about burning in hell are especially hard to accept. If I can’t see it, measure it, or reason my way to it, it doesn’t land.

_To be fair, there are things I accept as good even though the only evidence is personal and experiential. Bringing joy makes me feel happy, so I keep doing it. Gratitude practices lift my mood, even if I can’t prove why. Not everything needs to be double-blind tested to matter._

An incredibly good discussion on belief (easily applied to religion), hidden in a discussion of pychics between the host and Dan Harris. I highly, highly recommend (and much better then the Search engine on religion for the parts that pertain to belief). [Search Engine - The Psychic Question
](https://podscan.fm/podcasts/search-engine/episodes/the-psychic-question)

- While I think the tarot people are wrong, they frankly throw much better parties than the fact checkers. So there's that. But then you spend enough time around the believers and sometimes you feel your own killjoyness more acutely, like you're on a diet or fasting for reasons nobody else quite understands. Wouldn't it be nicer to just give in?
- Open is better than closed, right? Fluid is better than rigid. People who are too sure of themselves tend to be alienating to others.
- Dan is somebody who tries not to believe in stories just because they're comfortable. He doesn't usually get his aura read. He's not religious. He does meditate, and he's Buddhist enough that I've heard him use words like dharma in casual conversation. The story Dan tells himself, though, is that he came to Buddhism because he followed the evidence for it, which I'm sure is true, although I also think most of us decide what to believe, at least partly socially. It's much easier to surrender to an idea if we admire the people who already hold it, if they seem happy, smart, if they fit our arbitrary thumbnail sketch of a wise person."
- As Dan and I kept talking over the months, I'd noticed how many stories he had about his teachers, memories of the lessons he'd learned by observing them. It's such a funny thing that happens in the human heart, this decision that you're going to become somebody's student, surrender to their ideas or habits

### Hypocrisy

The problem is hypocrisy. Religion has plenty of examples of evil done in its name, or leaders exploiting faith for personal gain. To be fair, that isn’t unique to religion — some people are just shitty and will exploit whatever they can.

_To be fair, I’ve also seen religion call people to their best selves. In community, people often act with generosity and service, not exploitation. That doesn’t erase the bad, but it balances it._

### Pushiness

The problem is pushiness. Again, not unique to religion, but easy to see there. If someone really believes they hold the greatest gift in the world, of course they want to share it. If someone thinks they’re protecting you, of course they’ll try to stop you from doing something dangerous. I get the intent, but it can feel suffocating.

_To be fair, I’ve been pushy too. When I care deeply, I want to convince people. If I believe something makes life better, I share it — sometimes too strongly. So I get where the impulse comes from, even if I don’t like being on the receiving end._

### Arbitrariness & Literalism

The problem is arbitrariness. I struggle with random literal interpretations, absolute faith, and the inability to question. It feels like being asked to accept rules without context, as if the meaning is locked and you’re not allowed to ask why.

_To be fair, I can see the upside. If we really did have a universal standard, there would be no argument about morality. Everyone would know where the lines are, and that certainty would be a relief. It's also comforting not to have to figure everything out on your own — sometimes having the rules spelled out is easier than reinventing the code of life from scratch._

## What Is God Anyway?

When I read devotionals each morning, I keep trying to do a mental find-and-replace - if I swap out "God" with something secular, what word would I use? "Universe" feels like a cop-out. "Myself" doesn't capture it either. Then it hit me: I can't do a simple find-and-replace because God isn't one thing - God is doing ten different jobs simultaneously: source of confidence, moral framework, community identifier, ritual designer. Religious people get all of that in one package. Secular people have to cobble together ten different solutions from ten different sources. But here's the twist: religious people face their own cobbling challenge. With conflicting scriptures, denominations, and interpretations, how do they know THEIR understanding of God is correct? And what makes their path actually different from mine?

### The many meanings of God

When I read devotionals and replace "God" with a secular concept, I realize God serves multiple roles simultaneously. Here are the main ones I've identified, with both religious and secular wisdom for each:

**Source of Confidence & Resilience:** The bone-deep certainty that I'll be okay, even when everything feels overwhelming.

| Religious Wisdom                                                                                                                                                   | Secular Wisdom                                                  |

### The Secular Challenge of having to cobble together your own god

Without a religious framework, you face the burden of construction. Look at that list above - ten fundamental roles that religion fills with one answer: God. As a secular person, I need ten different sources, ten different practices, ten different communities.

How do I know my ethics are right? What gives me confidence when everything is uncertain? Where do I find community? What rituals mark important transitions? Should I follow Stoicism or Buddhism or just wing it? Is my meditation practice actually helping or am I just sitting quietly convincing myself it matters?

The work is exhausting: reading philosophy, testing practices, iterating on what works, constantly second-guessing. Did I choose the right framework? Am I missing something important? There's no instruction manual, no authoritative voice saying "this is the way."

Every major decision becomes a research project. Every value requires justification. Every ritual feels slightly made-up because, well, it is.

The stress isn't just about doing the work - it's about never knowing if you got it right. Religious people can say "God says so" and move on. I'm stuck with "well, based on my reading of philosophy and my personal experience and the limited research I could find, I think maybe this approach..."

That uncertainty is exhausting.

### The Religious Challenge of having to cobble together your own god

At first glance, religion seems easier - the "word of God is defined." But is it really?

Consider the conflicts:

- Between religions (Christianity vs Judaism vs Islam vs Buddhism)
- Between sects (Catholic vs Protestant vs Orthodox, Sunni vs Shia)
- Between interpretations (literal vs metaphorical, conservative vs progressive)
- Within scripture itself (contradictory verses, unclear guidance)

So religious people face their own cobbling challenge: **How do I know MY interpretation of God's will is correct?**

The answer I keep hearing: "I can feel it" or "I feel God's touch" or "The Holy Spirit guides me." But wait - isn't that the same as my secular approach? I test things, see what works, trust my experience. They pray, see what feels right, trust their spiritual sense.

### So what's actually different?

Looking at both paths, they have surprising similarities. Both require:

1. **Interpretation** - making sense of conflicting inputs
2. **Experiential testing** - does this work in my life?
3. **Community validation** - do others I respect agree?
4. **Ongoing refinement** - updating as you learn

But there are real differences:

**Confidence vs Uncertainty:** Religious people have confidence in their framework because it's backed by divine authority. Secular people are stuck with uncertainty because we know we're making it up as we go.

**Support Infrastructure:** Religious people have massive support systems for asking and answering life's big questions - weekly services, religious education, clergy who've dedicated their lives to these questions, thousands of years of texts, and a community expectation that you should wrestle with meaning. Secular people get self-help books and the occasional philosophical movie. There's no weekly gathering to ask "what's the good life?" together. No secular equivalent of a rabbi whose job is helping you think through ethics and meaning.

Which is better? I honestly don't know. The confidence sounds incredible - to just _know_ you're right. The support system sounds amazing. But I can't manufacture that confidence. My engineer brain won't let me stop questioning.

### How I'm Cobbling Mine Together

When I consider religious texts, I do this mental translation exercise:

- "God has a plan for you" → "Stay true to your eulogy virtues"
- "Trust in God" → "Focus on maximizing influence, not controlling outcomes"
- "God will provide" → "The universe is generally abundant if you're resourceful"
- "Pray without ceasing" → "Regular gratitude and reflection practice"
- "God loves you unconditionally" → "Practice self-compassion, you're doing your best"

Sometimes the translation feels clunky. Sometimes I wonder if I'm missing something profound by not just accepting the original. The devotional will say something beautiful about resting in God's love, and I'll think "that sounds amazing" - and then my brain immediately goes to "but how do I operationalize that without the God part?"

It's like trying to run Windows software on a Linux machine - constant compatibility issues, constant translation layers, never quite sure if you're getting the full experience.

But this is my path: taking wisdom where I find it, translating it into language that works for my engineer brain, testing whether it makes my life better. The cobbling feels messy and uncertain compared to the clean certainty of "God said it, I believe it."

## Some bible verses I really like

While I struggle with literal belief, I've found certain verses capture truths about how to live well. They're less about theology and more about practical wisdom - the kind that holds up whether you believe in God or not.

### Don't take Faith Blindly

- Proverbs 14:15 - "The simple believes everything, but the prudent gives thought to his steps."
- 1 Thessalonians 5:21 - "But test everything; hold fast what is good."
- 1 John 4:1 - "Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world."

### Be Tolerant Of Others

- Matthew 7:1 - "Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you."
- Matthew 7:12 - "So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets."
- Galatians 3:28 - "There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus."
- Romans 14:10 - "You, then, why do you judge your brother or sister? Or why do you treat them with contempt? For we will all stand before God's judgment seat."
- Romans 14:13 - "Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister."

### Be Deliberate, Disciplined, Daily

- Proverbs 25:28 - "A man without self-control is like a city broken into and left without walls."
- 1 Corinthians 9:27 - "But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified."
- Hebrews 12:11 - "For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it."

### Do the work

- 2 Thessalonians 3:10 - "For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: 'The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.'"
- Proverbs 13:4 - "Lazy people want much but get little, but those who work hard will prosper."
- Colossians 3:23 - "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters."

### Others I like and need to categorize

- Proverbs 27:17 - "As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another."

## Appendix and stuff I'm working in ...

### Why Religion?

Religions persist because they solve hard coordination problems: transmitting values across generations, creating social trust, and providing meaning under uncertainty. They encode “do this, not that” as embodied wisdom, not just abstract rules. My interest is pragmatic: learn from what works, name what harms, keep the parts that build resilient, prosocial humans.

### Belief vs Practice

The modern debate over belief often misses the power of practice. You don’t have to resolve every metaphysical claim to benefit from disciplined rituals: weekly reflection, shared meals, service, confession/repair, sabbath-style rest. Practice shapes identity through repetition; belief often follows behavior.

### Secular Spirituality

You can pursue awe, humility, gratitude, and service without formal religion. Meditation, nature, art, and shared work provide many of the same psychological benefits when practiced intentionally. The question isn't "religious or not," but "what practice reliably opens you to meaning while keeping you kind?"

### Am I really a Christian? 14 Signs (A text from 300 AD)

{% include youtube.html src="xoAFnsb1cmw" %}

A text from around 300 AD (possibly Lactantius) defines 14 signs of being a Christian.

This isn't just about Christians - these are exactly my ethics. See how they map to my affirmations:

{%include summarize-page.html src="/affirmations" %}

#### A class act: First Understand. Appreciate. Isn't that Curious

**Sign 1: Be merciful to all.** Not just to people you like, but to everyone. We all need mercy - patient, understanding, gentle, forgiving. The question isn't whether others deserve mercy, but whether you can offer it as freely as you hope to receive it.

**Sign 3: Give aid to the poor.** Not just the materially poor, but those poor in tenderness, companionship, love, kindness, and basic dignity. We're all poor in some way. The sin isn't being unable to help everyone - it's indifference, being too self-absorbed to see the neighbor right next to you who needs help.

**Sign 4: Suffer with the afflicted.** Before trying to fix problems, see the person. Imagine you're going through the exact same thing they are. **Compassion means "with suffering"** - just be there with their suffering. Then figure out solutions together.

**Sign 5: Participate in others' sorrows as though they were your own.** Let's go find each other's crosses and bear one another's burdens. When you see others carrying problems, don't just observe - fly to help.

**Sign 6: Be an open door to the unhappy.** Be the kind of person where anyone feels comfortable coming, where they can leave feeling a little more special, a little more loved, a little happier. Is your door mostly closed?

**Sign 7: Don't insult anymore.** Take a mental note of how many times you insult, mock, criticize, **judge**, or make fun of somebody throughout a day. Not just out loud - in your mind, under your breath, where only you and maybe God hears. When insulted, respond with no insult. If you say anything, answer gently.

#### Calm like water: Be Present. This too shall pass. Work the problem

**Sign 2: Don't get angry over small injuries.** How you react to every little annoyance is a barometer for your soul. Getting super irritated or flying off the hook over small things are symptoms that something is off inside. Your reaction is a choice.

**Sign 13: Rest your spirit and place your hope in something beyond yourself.** In times of desolation, where do you turn? Try this: take whatever is giving you anxiety or stress, hold it in your heart, then release it. Hand it over. Say "I know you can handle this, let your will be done" - then say nothing else and rest. We waste so much time and energy overthinking. This takes tremendous trust, but it's the way to peace.

#### Do It Anyways: Deliberate. Disciplined. Daily

_These could be essentialist, but putting them here for some balance._

**Sign 8: Serve what you love most.** Who or what do you worship day and night? When you look back, what's the one thing you've traded your life for? We serve who we love the most.

**Sign 9: Continuously meditate on your ways.** What occupies your mind throughout the day? Following any path well means choosing it daily, and to choose to follow someone, you first have to get to know them.

#### An essentialist: Know Essential. Provide Context. Prioritize Ruthlessly

**Sign 10: Be poor in the eyes of the world but rich in the eyes of what matters.** There's a certain way to live that's very pleasing to the world, and a certain way that's pleasing to deeper values - and they don't always align. Sometimes they're exact opposites. When vilified, bless. When persecuted, endure. When slandered, answer gently. When the world rolls their eyes, respond with goodness.

**Sign 11: Keep your soul simple and upright.** If you look inside a simple soul, you only find three things: goodness, love, and truth. An upright soul stands up for these three things. If your soul is off, you'll feel it as deep emptiness or restlessness. If it's good, you'll feel peace.

**Sign 12: Keep your conscience faithful and pure.** Your conscience is that thing deep down that lets you know whether what you're thinking, doing, or have done is good or bad. A pure conscience echoes only what's right. A faithful conscience listens. The more you ignore it, the weaker it gets, opening the door for other voices. Ask yourself: Who is my conscience faithful to? Am I faithful to my conscience?

**Sign 14: Prefer eternal treasures to temporary ones.** If you had a choice between all the treasure the world has to offer and all the treasure that truly matters, which would you choose?
