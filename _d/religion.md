I did my Bar Mitzvah at the Wailing Wall in Isreal — the holiest place in Judaism. We flew there as a family, and I still remember stepping off the plane and feeling an intense warmth. I turned to my sister and whispered, “I can feel God.” She rolled her eyes and said, “That’s not God. That’s forty degrees Celsius.”

## My story

### How I Became a Man at 13

I grew up in a small town, with a conservative synagogue. Services were always in Hebrew — a language my dad didn’t know, and neither did I. But hearing the words week after week, we memorized the prayer songs by repetition. To me, the words were gobbledygook, but the melodies stuck.

Every Friday night we would walk to services. My dad didn’t believe in God, but he loved the synagogue. For him it wasn’t about belief; it was about community. Because the congregation was small, they often struggled to gather the ten men needed for certain prayers. Most weeks the phone would ring, and they’d ask him to come. We lived just five minutes away, so he always did.

When you’re Jewish, turning thirteen means becoming a man — you study the Torah and have a Bar Mitzvah. My grandparents had immigrated to Israel, so when it was my turn, we flew there. It was my first time on a plane. I had my Bar Mitzvah at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem, the most holy place in Judaism. Standing there, surrounded by history and prayer, made it unforgettable.

### When Proof Became My Religion

I am an engineer: science, cause and effect, proof. If you can’t measure it, model it, or test it, you don’t trust it. No proof, no belief. Stories without evidence - bugs in the system. Miracles? Not reproducible. God? No causal mechanism. The whole thing looked like bad engineering.

Why would I build my life on something that couldn’t even pass a basic test plan?

What I didn’t see then was that religion doesn’t live or die on proof — it lives in practice.

### The Day I valued Religion

Just a normal day at work, the phone rang out of the blue. “Igor, please sit down.” My dad was dead. I had no idea what to do, but my synagogue — basically the Jewish version of a church — did. In Judaism, the dead are buried quickly, usually within 24 hours, so there’s no time to get lost in indecision. You just follow the steps.

At the funeral, the rabbi put a tie around my neck, and cut it. Why did that feel important? Who knows, who cares — it just did. Then the congregation sang a song. Even though it was in Hebrew, gobbledygook to me, I remembered the melody from before. It was incredibly comforting, it was right. I just knew everyone was there, supporting me.

At the graveyard, when we were putting him into the ground, I could see the names of his friends from my Bar Mitzvah days on the gravestones beside him. I could picture him laughing with them, and knowing he was with his friends gave me a sense of peace.

Then came shiva, the seven days of mourning. A candle burned the whole time, a quiet reminder that life had paused. For a week, people came, prayed, sat with us. At the end, the candle went out, and the expectation was to begin stepping back into the world. Not to “move on,” but to take a step forward.

After that came shloshim, the thirty days of softer mourning, and later, yahrzeit, the annual prayer and candle to remember. These rituals stretched out across time, creating a rhythm of grief and remembrance.

What I valued most was the certainty of what to do. I didn’t have to ask, “Am I grieving right?” The protocol answered that. And being in community meant I wasn’t alone. Major life events stopped feeling like cruel surprises — I could see that others had walked this path before me.

That was the day religion showed its worth to me: not in metaphysics, but in structure and support when I needed them most.

### In my 40s all the other stuff

## Why Religion?

Religions persist because they solve hard coordination problems: transmitting values across generations, creating social trust, and providing meaning under uncertainty. They encode “do this, not that” as embodied wisdom, not just abstract rules. My interest is pragmatic: learn from what works, name what harms, keep the parts that build resilient, prosocial humans.

## Belief vs Practice

The modern debate over belief often misses the power of practice. You don’t have to resolve every metaphysical claim to benefit from disciplined rituals: weekly reflection, shared meals, service, confession/repair, sabbath-style rest. Practice shapes identity through repetition; belief often follows behavior.

## Community, Ritual, and Identity

Healthy communities make belonging conditional on contribution, not conformity. Good rituals are scaffolding: they mark time, create memory, and bind people together without demanding uniformity of thought. The failure modes are obvious—tribalism, purity tests, coercion—so design for generosity, accountability, and repair.

## Secular Spirituality

You can pursue awe, humility, gratitude, and service without formal religion. Meditation, nature, art, and shared work provide many of the same psychological benefits when practiced intentionally. The question isn’t “religious or not,” but “what practice reliably opens you to meaning while keeping you kind?”

## My Working Principles

- **Start with practice** – Small, repeated actions beat grand statements.
- **Choose communities that repair** – Conflict is inevitable; repair is optional. Make it mandatory.
- **Keep sabbath** – Regularly stop. Rest is a moral technology, not a luxury.
- **Honor the dead, serve the living** – Remember where you came from; invest where you can help now.
- **Measure by fruits** – Are people becoming kinder, braver, and more truthful?
