Training Emotional Intelligence through mindfulness. Search inside yourself is a meditation training manual for engineers. It's also a pun as the author works at google, and built the program internally at Google. Joy on demand by the same author, is less engineer focused, and uses joy as a path to medatitive bliss.

This is a summary of [Search Inside Yourself](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0070XF474/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1) and [Joy on Demand](https://www.amazon.com/Joy-Demand-Discovering-Happiness-Within/dp/0062378872), and the place I learned many of my [emotional health practices](/emotional-health)

FYI, I now do a different practice; See my experience with [SKY](/ig66/685)

### 1) What is Emotional Intelligence (EI)? How to train it?

{%include local_image_float_right.html src="raccoon-meditate.png" %}

_Even engineers can use empathy_

- **GOAL:EI is a collection of trainable skills, this book teaches them.**
- IE is Ability to monitor your, and others, feelings, and use the info to guide your own thinking and actions.
- Background on EI: [What makes a leader](/what-makes-a-leader) article.
- Foundational Skill 1: Focus attention
- Foundational Skill 2: Perceive feelings in the body since body manifests feelings
  1. before mind realizes it
  2. with more granularity.
- Mindfulness is THE WAY to build those foundational skills.
- Once have the mindfulness can use to build the components of EI.
- Easy and Easier Mindfulness Methods. **Easy** follow the breath. **Easier** have no thoughts.

### 2) Theory and practice of mindfulness

_Breathing as if your life depends on it._

- **GOAL: Be Relaxed, Non Judgmental, and Alert at the same time.**
- Meditation trains Attention(ability to concentrate), Meta-Attention(notice not paying attention).
  - Like bike balancing. Constantly re-balancing so seems like rider always balanced.
- Meditation is like exercise
  - Work out, tough work out, much better then no workout.
  - More you practice stronger you become.
  - After a while, you just feel better and not sure why.
- Intention - Intention == Affirmation == mental habit == good.
- **Grandmother mind:** be gentle with yourself, the more you do it, the more of a habit it becomes.
- Process Model:
  - External Observer: Follow Breath, Distracted, Regain Focus
- Dealing with distraction
  - Experience without judging or reacting
  - If you need to react, continue being mindful
  - Let it go
  - Sitting Time
- Concepts I'm not summarizing
  - Proper meditation posture
  - Dude where is the science.
  - Happiness default state of mind.

### 3) Extend mindfulness beyond formal practice

_Mindfulness without butt on cushion_

- **Goal: Extend from formal to informal situations (rest to activity) and from self to others.**
- Mindfulness in activity
  - Will happen naturally from formal practice, but you can accelerate it.
  - Imagine focusing on every meal as if it was prepared by a world class chef.
  - Walking can be a formal "activity based" meditation.
- Directing mindfulness on others. Informal/formal practice of mindful listening/conversation.
  - Focusing on others, give them your full, non-judgmental attention.
- Formal Practice of Mindful Listening
  - Speaker: Speak for 3 uninterrupted minutes. You own them, even if silence.
  - Listener: No speaking, acknowledge (maybe, but don't over acknowledge). If silence, be silent.
  - Swap speaker.
  - Meta conversation on process: How do you feel, anything you want to talk about.
- Informal Practice of Mindful Listening
  - Give the gift of your full attention.
  - Because they're your close one, they deserve time and space to express themselves.
  - When attention wanders, bring it back.
- Mindful Conversation
  - A. Mindful Listening
  - B. Looping - close the loop, by repeating what you think you understood. Speaker works with you till fully understood.
  - C. Dipping - We usually don't listen as we've wandered off. Dip into yourself
    _ Listener - notice if you're being distracted, try to let it go.
    _ Speaker - notice how this makes you feel, decide to talk about it, or let it go.
- Formal Mindful Conversation
  - Monologue 4 minutes: \* Listener: Pay attention, and periodically dip.
  - Looping: 6 minutes to describe what i heard, and loop.
  - Meta: 4 minutes meta conversation.
- Informal Mindful Conversation
  - Just like formal method, but you don't tell.
  - Be sure to seek permission for looping - what you said sounds important, can I check what I understood?
  - Consider explaining what you did, and let the other person join you.
- Sustaining your practice
  - Like exercise, only hard for first few months. Tips
    1. Have a buddy ask: Am I doing it? Why is my life better? How did this conversation go?
    1. Do less then you can
    1. At a minimum, do a breathe/1 minute/2 minute.
  - Keep the difficulty at just below what you can achieve - think of how video games work.
- Lightness and Joy in Mediation
  - Want a relaxed (light) focus on meditation. Try meditating on Joyful event.
    - Bring full attention to something pleasant, holding kids hand, a nice meal, etc.
  - Theory: This gain can be generalized to other practices, but still need formal meditation.
  - Eventually Meditation causes - Sukha - non-energy expending joy.
- Mastering focused and open attention:
  - Focused attention - intense focus on chosen object.
  - Open attention - let focus move to any incoming event without judgement.
  - Values from circuits
    - Requires Strong Meta Attention to stay on focus
    - Strong clarity - analogy, strong torch light
    - Relaxed Attention - needed so don't get exhausted from meditation.
- Meditation Circuit Training (4x)
  - 3 minute closed - keep focus on breath.
  - 3 minutes open - allow focus to apply to each incoming thought
- Stay motivated - you're going to suck till you don't
- Walking Meditation
  - Focus on walking while walking.
  - Feel your feet touching the ground
  - Don't take anything for granted.

### Working with suffering

When suffering, you need to get to the cognative reframes, but first you need to be able to focus clearly, this requirs calming the mind and experiences the pain (and first joy) to handle the reframes.

Step 1: **Calm the mind** Need to be calm enough to observe and experience.

Step 2A: **Affective - experience joy**

- Can always find joy
- Like an oasis in the dessert
- Some days harder then others
- Some days impossible, just need to wait
- Train in non
- pain makes it easier, like gym.

Step 2B: **Affective - experience pain**

- Pain in Body
- Tension
- Pit in stomach
- Heart pounding
- Nausia
- Be willing to experience the pain in the body

Approach:

- Realize unpleasant experiences in the body
- Realize root cause of suffering is aversion
- Apply loving kindness to the aversion and the self
- Apply equinimity - be calm watching the emotions
- These emotions are not me
- These thoughts are not me
- Just bodily experiences

Step 3: **Cognition - Use your cognition to resolve**

- Many reframes
- Caused by others
  - apply kindness and compassion
  - Think the best of the person
  - Human attribute error
  - Get mad at suffering not the person. Like mad at the thrower not the rock.
- Caused by self/mistake
  - apply kindness and compassion to self
  - See through eyes of best friend
- Something bad has/will happen - test if catastrophizing. We make up stories
- Gain perspective - more time, more dimensions
- Realize what a mircle everything is - earth/civilizatoin/body/etc
- With humor - no humor; no perspective

**Failure comes pre-installed**

- First I walk down the street, don't see the hole and walk in
- Second, I see hole, and walk in.
  - The hardest day
  - You see the hole, but can't stop yourself as don't know how
- Third, I see the hole, and I avoid it
  - Build the ability to fix the problem, to walk around the hole.

It's like juggling. Just because you can juggle 3 balls, you can't juggle 4 or 5 or 7.

Also like diving. Any small issue can kill you.

Dive training requires handling and practicing each failure mode.

New divers can handle 1 problem, and then frequently abort their dive.
Experienced diver can probably handle 2 or 3 then abort
Pro divers can handle several combinations of problems.
