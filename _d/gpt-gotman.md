The Gottman Method is a research-based approach to couples therapy developed by Drs. John and Julie Gottman. The method is based on the idea that happy and healthy relationships require a strong foundation of love and friendship, as well as the ability to handle conflict in a positive way. The acronym NURTURE stands for the seven key components of the Gottman Method: Navigating Love Maps, Unleashing Fondness and Admiration, Responding to Bids for Attention, Tackling Conflict Constructively, Uplifting Dreams and Aspirations, Renewing Relationship Rituals, and Embracing Shared Meaning. In this book, we will explore each of these components in depth, providing practical advice, exercises, and journal prompts to help you apply the Gottman Method to your own relationship.
