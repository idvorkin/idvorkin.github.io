To discuss the 7 habits we need some foundational ideas, P/PC, paradigms, etc. These are my insights based on the [7 habits](/7h) Chapter 0.

### Inside Out

To change the situation, change ourselves
We transform from the inside out. Change how we think, then change how we act and how we succeed.

### Charector vs Personality Ethic

Our integrity, vs our salesman ship

### Pardigm - rabbit vs duck

### Subjective vs Objective - Carrier vs Lighthouse

### Thoughts, Actions, Habits, Charector, Life

### Depednant, Independant, Interdependant

Sow a thought, reap an action. Sow and action reap a habit, sow a habit, reap a charector, sow a charector rep our destiny.

### Effectiveness, P/PC Balance

My video in [balance](/balance)

### Assets: Physical, Financial, Human

### Mental Models: Map vs Terrain

Using your eyes you can look at the road outside your house. It has a color, a specific width, perhaps some potholes. This the terrain, the physical reality, but you won't see any of this google maps. Your eyes won't let you see the networks of sewers underneath your street. Fort that, there are maps that show the sewers, but those maps lack houses.

Maps are required as the world is infinitly complex, and we need simpler models to understand what is going on. A similar thing happens at the restaurant, your order of the menu which is a simplification of the food. And to understand the world, we need mental models, like the ones presented in most non-fiction books.

While maps are useful, they are not the terrain, in some dimensiosn the map is always wrong, and classifying the edges is hard.

There will be several maps to understand the terrain. Like the street map and the sewer map. These maps will often disagree, or be non-overlapping, and that's completely fine each map has its own purpose.

Often your maps are limited by the map maker, - for example:

_A group of blind men heard that a strange animal, called an elephant, had been brought to the town, but none of them were aware of its shape and form. Out of curiosity, they said: "We must inspect and know it by touch, of which we are capable". So, they sought it out, and when they found it they groped about it. The first person, whose hand landed on the trunk, said, "This being is like a thick snake". For another one whose hand reached its ear, it seemed like a kind of fan. As for another person, whose hand was upon its leg, said, the elephant is a pillar like a tree-trunk. The blind man who placed his hand upon its side said the elephant, "is a wall". Another who felt its tail, described it as a rope. The last felt its tusk, stating the elephant is that which is hard, smooth and like a spear._

### Teach others to teach yourself

### How we "see" the problem, becomes our subjective problem.

From [Sleight of Mouth](/som)

_Language, often unknown to us, creates our mental models, our reality, and defines our meaning. But the model is not the terrain, and by engaging with the language we can change mental models. Sleight of mouth (SoM) is a series of techniques for changing our models, reality and meanings and thus our experiences. Our mental models are a frame, and we need help going from a 'problem frame' to a 'desired outcome frame' , a 'failure frame', to a 'feedback frame' and an 'impossible frame ' to an 'as if' frame. To experience the power of language, find anything that is invisible to you, and name it. Now as you've given it a name, see how perceive it, and become aware of it._
