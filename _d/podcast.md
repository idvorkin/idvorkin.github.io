To my amazement, I listen to podcasts. I think they're pretty interesting, here are my notes on them.

## Theory/Random Thoughts

### Why is engagement/retention better with podcasts

### What is good about podcasts.

- Probably not podcasts, but interviews.
- I suspect it engages some empathy as if you want to eavesdrop on a conversation.
- You also build rapport with the hosts - who has a personality you bond with.

### How did I end up listening to podcasts

## Tech

- Kris Jenkins

### AI Generated Podcasts - Google's NotebookLLM

Google made [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/) as a sleeper hit. Basically auto create podcasts as a part of a random project - and everyone loves it!

- Get tech depth from Simon: https://simonwillison.net/tags/notebooklm/
- There is magic in how the hosts do the non-human banter. I lost the word for what this is.

### Podcast as GPT Output

That's what I think is ultimately so compelling about the 2-person podcast format as a UIUX exploration. It lifts two major "barriers to enjoyment" of LLMs. 1 Chat is hard. You don't know what to say or ask. In the 2-person podcast format, the question asking is also delegated to an AI so you get a lot more chill experience instead of being a synchronous constraint in the generating process. 2 Reading is hard and it's much easier to just lean back and listen.

### My own podcast generator

2 parts:

1. Generate the podcast script from source material - I seem to have lost where I did this.
2. Convert to [audio using ElevenLabs](https://github.com/idvorkin/nlp/blob/777c10e0b525951916e13b7a2d3bd3fe151dbb92/tts.py?plain=1#L117)
