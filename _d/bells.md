There's no way I'm swinging that thing between my legs, I'm going to kill my back. When I started working out with a trainer, they tried to get me to do a kettlebell swing, and I was like no way. Then they spend 3 weeks teaching me Turkish Getups, which I absolutely loved. Then I read simple and sinister, and now I've achieved timeless simple, and do heavy clubs instead of halos.

I instantly liked Turkish Get Ups (TGUs) they have a nice flow and feel great. The trainer tried to get me to do swings, but I'm afraid of ballistic exercises so declined.

A year later I decided to try them, and I love them! At 44 every day I woke up my back would be stiff till I stretched out. When I started doing swings, the next day my back was as loose as a 30-year-old's :)
