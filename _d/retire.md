## The Emotional Journey of Retirement

The decision to retire triggers a complex emotional journey. It's not just about leaving a job; it's about transitioning to a new phase of life that can bring up feelings of excitement, anxiety, loss, and liberation all at once.

One often overlooked aspect is maintaining strong social connections. Studies show that doubling your number of real-life friends has the same effect on well-being as a 50% increase in income.

## Identity Beyond Work

For many of us, especially in tech, our work forms a significant part of our identity. Who are we when we're no longer defined by our profession? This section explores building a multi-faceted identity that transcends our career.

As we transition from our professional identity, it's important to focus on what we're moving toward, not just what we're leaving behind.

## Financial Independence vs Retirement

These terms are often used interchangeably, but they represent different concepts and life choices. Financial independence gives you options, while retirement is just one of those options.

Some key financial considerations:

- Understanding your taxes and how they change in retirement
- Building multiple income streams
- Healthcare planning and Medicare considerations
- Work-life balance considerations leading up to retirement
- Finding balance between production and personal time
