Someone important to me has been reading a daily devotional. Even though I'm not religious, I'm studying with them to be able to have conversations about the insights - whether in a secular or religious context. This is my attempt to bridge two worlds: honoring the spiritual wisdom they're finding while translating it into language that works for my engineer brain.

## What Is a Daily Devotional?

A daily devotional is a short reading - usually a page or two - combining scripture, reflection, and prayer. The format is remarkably consistent:

1. **A Bible verse** - the anchor for the day's theme
2. **A story or reflection** - connecting the verse to modern life
3. **A prayer or action step** - making it practical

It's designed to be read first thing in the morning, setting the tone for the day. Think of it as a spiritual vitamin - a small, concentrated dose of meaning before the chaos begins.

## Why I'm Doing This

I'm not doing this to become religious. I'm doing it because:

**My 3rd Affirmation** - Of course! [Be a class act](/eulogy#be-a-class-act). This devotional practice is part of living that value with integrity.

**Connection** - This person matters to me. When they talk about what they're learning, I want to actually understand, not just nod politely. This is Habit 5 in action: [Seek first to understand](/7-habits#habit-5-seek-first-to-understand-then-to-be-understood), then to be understood.

**Curiosity** - If something is helping someone I respect, I want to know what's in there. What wisdom am I missing by dismissing it outright?

**Translation practice** - Can I take religious wisdom and find the secular equivalent? Or does something get lost in translation that I should pay attention to?

**Intellectual honesty** - I've been critical of religion without actually engaging with it seriously. That's lazy. Time to do the work.

## The Translation Challenge

Every morning I read the devotional twice:

**First pass:** Just read it as written. Let the religious language sit there. Don't rush to translate.

**Second pass:** The translation game. When it says "God," what would I say instead? When it talks about prayer, what's my equivalent practice?

Some days the translation is clean:

- "Trust God's plan" → "Focus on influence, not control"
- "Pray without ceasing" → "Practice continuous gratitude"

Other days the translation feels lossy, like I'm missing something essential by removing the divine element. Those are the days I sit with longer.

#### October 20th - Seeing His Face

To me this is really about: **Self-compassion/self-acceptance.**

My favorite line in the pasage: **"If God accepts me as I am, I'd better do the same."**

**Important distinction:** Acceptance isn't surrender. It's not "this is who I am and I'll never change." True acceptance means "I accept where I am right now AND I have hope for improvement." (Without the hope part, acceptance becomes resignation - that's bad)

{%include summarize-page.html src="/compassion" %}
{%include summarize-page.html src="/get-to-yes-with-yourself" %}

#### October 21st - The Pleasure of God

To me this is really about: **You get to choose if you're happy or miserable - might as well choose happy.**

My favorite line from the passage: **How would you characterize your relationship with God? Cold and sterile? Distant and frustrating? It need not be any of these. It can actually be—dare we suggest it?—fun**

_Here's the tale I use that's coherent with this passage:_

There's this beggar I pass every day. Dirty face, few teeth, hunched over. His life is objectively harder than mine. But he's always got the biggest smile - while I'm usually rushing past in my own head, stressed about nothing.

One day, in an especially foul mood, I stopped. "How are you always so happy?"

He looked me dead in the eye: "Listen man, every day I wake up and choose. Miserable or happy. I choose happy."

**Important distinction:** This isn't toxic positivity or denying real hardship. It's recognizing that even in difficult circumstances, you have agency over your internal state. The beggar's life is still hard - but his choice to face it with happiness doesn't make the hardship disappear, it changes his experience of it.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/happy" %}

#### October 22nd - Praying in God's mind

To me this is really about: **Soul-searching to find your essentialist position - and doing it regularly.**

My favorite line from the passage: **"Ask for His wisdom. Pray for His thoughts. Look for a drastic revision to your character and your dreams, and then pray the desires of the new you."**

_Here's how I translate this:_

Prayers for wisdom aren't that different from doing the deep soul-searching to figure out your essentialist position. What actually matters? What's the signal versus the noise? What should I focus on versus politely decline?

It's like my essentialist affirmation - reminding myself what the one thing is that makes everything else easier or unnecessary.

And doing it frequently? That's the do-it-anyway affirmation. Because here's the catch: wisdom keeps changing. What mattered last month might not be the priority this month. Your circumstances shift, you grow, the world changes.

So you can't just figure out your essentialist position once and be done. You have to keep looking for wisdom because it's a moving target.

**Important distinction:** This isn't about being wishy-washy or lacking conviction. It's about recognizing that wisdom is context-dependent. The right answer for yesterday might not be the right answer for today. Regular reflection isn't indecision - it's staying calibrated.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/essentialism" %}
{%include summarize-page.html src="/affirmations" %}

#### October 23rd - Perspective

To me this is really about: **Transcendence - seeing beyond yourself, knowing you're not the center of the universe.**

My favorite line from the passage: **"Has your perspective become distorted? Do your problems seem huge?"**

_Here's how I translate this:_

When you lose perspective, everything becomes catastrophic. A minor setback feels like the end of the world. A criticism feels like a personal attack. Not getting what you want feels like cosmic injustice.

But perspective is about getting small - recognizing your problems are a tiny speck in the vastness of time and space. This connects to my "Calm Like Water" affirmation: "Be present, this too shall pass, work the problem." The "this too shall pass" part is both temporal (it will pass) and cosmic (you're not that important in the grand scheme).

It's also about coherence - distinguishing your circle of influence from your circle of concern. Perspective lets you focus energy on what you can actually affect, instead of burning out trying to control everything beyond your reach.

**Important distinction:** Perspective isn't about minimizing real problems or toxic positivity. It's about calibrating the size of your response to the actual size of the problem. A real crisis deserves a crisis response. But not every disappointment is a crisis. Perspective helps you tell the difference.

#### October 24th - Pure Joy

To me this is really about: **Resilience and reframing - what doesn't kill you proves you're not dead.**

My favorite line from the passage: **"What rational person would consider the trials of life pure joy? Only those who can see the surprising benefit in them."**

_Here's how I translate this:_

There's a version of "what doesn't kill you makes you stronger" that I actually believe: what doesn't kill you proves you're not dead. It's not that hardship automatically makes you better - it's that surviving hardship reveals you're still in the game.

And there's real power in seeing the bright side when things are hard. Not toxic positivity that denies the difficulty, but genuine reframing. This too shall pass - both the good and the bad.

One of my jobs as a manager is to be the person who looks on the bright side. When a seagull poops on your head, I'm the one who says "How lucky you are! This is like a glorious massage - it's warm, it's good for your skin, all that jazz." Is it ridiculous? Absolutely. But sometimes the ridiculous reframe is exactly what breaks the catastrophic thinking.

The "pure joy" framing works when you can see the surprising benefit in trials. Not because suffering is good, but because you've learned that you usually find something valuable on the other side. Pattern recognition breeds optimism - not blind optimism, but earned optimism from repeatedly discovering unexpected benefits in difficulties.

**Important distinction:** This isn't about pretending hardship doesn't hurt or that you should be grateful for suffering. It's about recognizing that your perspective on difficulty shapes your experience of it. The seagull poop is still poop - but choosing to find humor in it makes it less awful. This is different from denying reality; it's choosing which aspect of reality to focus on. The pain is real AND you can still find benefits. Both can be true.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/happy" %}

#### October 26th - Wisdom through Prayer

To me this is really about: **Prayer as cognitive work - the mental labor of thinking hard and reconsidering frequently.**

_This builds on [October 22nd's insight](#october-22nd---praying-in-gods-mind) about prayer as soul-searching, but with a crucial distinction:_

October 22nd focused on prayer as a tool for finding wisdom and your essentialist position. But here's the key that matters even more: **prayer isn't about passively expecting God to inflate your mind with wisdom without doing the work.** Prayer IS the work itself - the active cognitive labor of thinking hard, reconsidering, and wrestling with questions.

_Here's how I translate this:_

Prayer for wisdom is the practice of deep, intentional thinking - not outsourcing your cognition to the divine. It's the mental work of examining your beliefs, challenging your assumptions, and reconsidering what you thought you knew. And it requires doing this work frequently because wisdom isn't static.

The scriptures are clear about this:

- **Hebrews 11:6**: God rewards those who "diligently seek him" - the Greek word means to zealously seek with all your heart, strength, and might. Not passive waiting.
- **Matthew 7:7**: "Ask, seek, knock" - all active verbs requiring persistence and engagement.
- **Philippians 2:12-13**: "Work out your salvation with fear and trembling" - you must actively work out what has been worked in. **Grace is opposed to earning, not effort.**
- **Colossians 4:2**: "Devote yourselves to prayer, keeping alert in it" - the labor of prayer requires alertness and devotion.

In secular terms: wisdom requires the cognitive labor of reflection. It's not about hoping the answer will magically appear - it's about putting in the mental work to find it. Like the essentialist affirmation, you have to keep doing the hard thinking to figure out what matters, and you have to do it repeatedly because the answer keeps changing.

**Important distinction:** This isn't about rejecting divine help or inspiration - it's about recognizing that even divine wisdom requires human effort to receive and integrate. The religious version says "God provides wisdom to those who diligently seek it." The secular version says "wisdom emerges from consistent, intentional cognitive work." Both require you to do the actual thinking - there's no shortcut around the mental labor.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/essentialism" %}

#### October 27th - Wisdom through Meditation

To me this is really about: **Deep reflection - thinking hard about principles, not just reading them quickly.**

My favorite line from the passage: **"What does that mean? It means to chew on it, think of what God does with it and why it came from His mouth, how we've failed it in our past, and how it might be applied in our everyday lives."**

_This builds on both [October 22nd's insight](#october-22nd---praying-in-gods-mind) about soul-searching and [October 26th's insight](#october-26th---wisdom-through-prayer) about prayer as cognitive work:_

The metaphor of "chewing on" scripture isn't about passive consumption - it's about active, repeated engagement. You don't just swallow wisdom whole. You break it down, examine it from multiple angles, extract the nutrients.

_Here's how I translate this:_

Real learning happens through deep reflection, not surface-level reading. Whether it's scripture, philosophy, or any principle you're trying to internalize - you need to:

1. **Think about the source** - Why does this principle exist? What problem does it solve? What's the deeper logic behind it?
2. **Examine your past** - Where have I failed to live by this? What were the consequences? What patterns do I see?
3. **Apply to your present** - How does this show up in my everyday life? What would it look like to actually practice this today?

This is the same process I do with my [essentialist affirmations](/affirmations) - I don't just recite them mechanically. I think about what they mean, how I've violated them recently, what situations call for them. The meditation isn't just sitting quietly with eyes closed - it's the active cognitive work of integration.

It's also similar to my practice with [Search Inside Yourself](/siy) - the formal meditation creates space for reflection, but the real work is examining your thoughts, patterns, and behaviors with curiosity rather than judgment.

**Important distinction:** This isn't about beating yourself up for past failures or overthinking until you're paralyzed. It's about engaged examination that leads to integration. You're not just memorizing the words - you're letting them reshape how you see and respond to the world. The "chewing" metaphor is perfect: it's repetitive, thorough work that breaks down what you've received so you can actually absorb it.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/affirmations" %}

#### October 28th - Wisdom through Recall

To me this is really about: **Meditation giving wisdom power - when you've internalized something deeply, it starts to guide you.**

My favorite line from the passage: **"When you've memorized a variety of Scripture passages, you will find them deeper and more relevant than ever before. When you're in the midst of a crisis, the Spirit will bring the right word into your situation."**

_Here's how I translate this:_

After you've meditated on something enough - really internalized it, repeated it, lived with it - it starts to guide you. It gives you power. This connects to one of my favorite lines: **"Repetition births ritual. Rituals become sacred. The sacred commands power."**

When you memorize Scripture (or affirmations, or principles), you're not just storing data - you're making something sacred through repetition. And when something becomes sacred to you, it commands power in your life. In a crisis, the right word surfaces not because you frantically search your notes, but because you've internalized it so deeply it's become part of how you think.

This is the difference between:

- **Having wisdom** (it's written down somewhere, searchable if you remember to look)
- **Being guided by wisdom** (it's so deeply internalized it shows up automatically when you need it)

My [affirmations practice](/affirmations) works the same way. I don't write them out daily just to remember them intellectually - I write them to ritualize them, to make them sacred, so they command power when I need them. When I'm stressed, "Calm like water: Be present. This too shall pass. Work the problem" surfaces automatically because I've repeated it hundreds of times.

The religious practice of memorizing Scripture serves this exact function: making wisdom so deeply part of you that the Spirit can "bring the right word into your situation." In secular terms: you've internalized it enough that your subconscious can surface the right pattern when you need it.

This also connects to how I think about journaling and the [AI journal practice](/ai-journal). The journal is the external memory system for discovering wisdom. But the affirmations are how I take discovered wisdom and make it sacred through repetition - turning it from something I know intellectually into something that actually guides me.

**Important distinction:** This isn't about mindless repetition or rigid dogma. The power comes from repeatedly engaging with wisdom that actually resonates with you - that's why affirmations need to "speak to you" to work. You can't force something to become sacred through mechanical repetition alone. The ritual needs authentic meaning behind it, or it's just empty repetition. But once something truly speaks to you, consistent ritual transforms it from knowledge into power.

#### October 31st - Wisdom through Fellowship

To me this is really about: **Tribe gives you wisdom, inspiration, and courage - you get smarter and braver when you're part of a group that challenges and complements your thinking.**

My favorite line from the passage: **"Don't idealize the church. It is made of redeemed but flawed people in a process of transformation. But don't underestimate it, either."**

_Here's how I translate this:_

Wisdom isn't just individual - it's distributed across a tribe. When you're part of a tribe, you get access to perspectives you'd never generate alone. Someone sees the blind spot you can't see. Someone has lived through the thing you're facing. Someone asks the question that breaks your stuck thinking.

There are sayings that capture this:

- **"Iron sharpens iron"** (Proverbs 27:17) - you get sharper through friction with others
- **"You become the average of your peers"** - so hang out with people better than you
- **"Be the dumbest person in the room"** - though careful, this wears you down after a while

What tribes actually give you:

- **Wisdom on what you don't know** - filling your blind spots
- **Inspiration when you're stuck** - seeing what's possible
- **Courage from seeing others have gone through it** - proof that the hard thing is survivable

I'm intellectually aligned with this. I know tribe matters. But I don't really do it - I don't have a tribe I regularly engage with for this kind of wisdom exchange. And that's probably costing me.

The passage warns against two extremes with church (or any tribe):

1. **Don't idealize it** - Tribes are made of flawed people. They'll disappoint you. They'll have bad takes. They'll fail to live up to the ideal you want them to be.
2. **Don't underestimate it** - Even with all the flaws, there's real wisdom and transformation that happens through fellowship. The wisdom, inspiration, and courage are real.

This connects to why I struggle with tribe: I tend to either idealize it (expecting perfect wisdom transmission, getting disappointed) or underestimate it (deciding I can figure everything out alone, which is hubris). Neither approach actually gets me the benefits.

The secular version: **Join tribes not for perfection but for wisdom, inspiration, and courage.** Find your people - even flawed people in process - and engage regularly. These benefits emerge from the collective, not from any single perfect source.

The "fellowship" isn't about blind conformity or groupthink - it's about the intellectual and emotional work that happens when you're regularly in conversation with people who care about similar things but see them differently than you do.

**Important distinction:** This isn't about finding an echo chamber or seeking validation. Real fellowship challenges you - it surfaces your blind spots, questions your assumptions, and offers perspectives you wouldn't generate alone. The discomfort of having your thinking challenged is a feature, not a bug. You don't need a perfect tribe or a tribe that agrees with you on everything. You need a tribe that's wrestling with similar questions and willing to think hard together. The "flawed people in process of transformation" part is crucial - everyone is figuring it out, and that shared vulnerability is what makes the wisdom exchange possible.

### November

#### November 1st - Jesus in This World

To me this is really about: **Finding and being your true self - your essentialist self.**

My favorite line from the passage: **"~~The life of Jesus in us~~ Being our essentialist self will make us ill-adapted to live comfortably in the ways of the world. But ~~the life of Jesus in us~~ being our true self will make us entirely satisfied as misfits."**

_Here's how I translate this:_

This is about the work of finding who you really are and then having the courage to be that person - even when the world pushes back against it. For me, finding my authentic self meant working on [my eulogy](/eulogy) - literally writing out who I want to be and how I want to be remembered. It's not a one-time decision. It's constant assessment: Am I being who I want to be? Am I living aligned with my true self? And then doing the hard work of course-correcting when the answer is no.

{%include summarize-page.html src="/eulogy" %}

The world wants you to fit in. To be comfortable. To not make waves. But when you're being your essentialist self - when you're living authentically as who you actually are - you won't fit comfortably into the world's boxes. You'll be ill-adapted to the standardized paths everyone else is walking.

And that's the point.

The misfits are the ones who know themselves deeply enough to be satisfied with not fitting in. They're not satisfied _because_ they're misfits - they're satisfied because they're being true to themselves. The misfit status is just the natural consequence of authenticity.

This connects to the essentialist position from [October 22nd](#october-22nd---praying-in-gods-mind) - constantly doing the soul-searching to figure out what matters. But this takes it further: once you know what matters, you have to actually _be_ that person. Even when it's uncomfortable. Even when you don't fit.

The work is worth it. Being a satisfied misfit beats being a miserable conformist.

**Important distinction:** This isn't about being contrarian for its own sake or rejecting everything conventional just to be different. It's about knowing yourself well enough to recognize when fitting in would require betraying who you are. Some people's true selves happen to align well with conventional paths - that's fine. But if your true self doesn't fit the mold, forcing yourself into it creates a different kind of suffering. The goal is authenticity, not rebellion. The misfit status is a side effect, not the objective.
