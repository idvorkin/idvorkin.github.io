Someone important to me has been reading a daily devotional. Even though I'm not religious, I'm studying with them to be able to have conversations about the insights - whether in a secular or religious context. This is my attempt to bridge two worlds: honoring the spiritual wisdom they're finding while translating it into language that works for my engineer brain.

## What Is a Daily Devotional?

A daily devotional is a short reading - usually a page or two - combining scripture, reflection, and prayer. The format is remarkably consistent:

1. **A Bible verse** - the anchor for the day's theme
2. **A story or reflection** - connecting the verse to modern life
3. **A prayer or action step** - making it practical

It's designed to be read first thing in the morning, setting the tone for the day. Think of it as a spiritual vitamin - a small, concentrated dose of meaning before the chaos begins.

## Why I'm Doing This

I'm not doing this to become religious. I'm doing it because:

**Connection** - This person matters to me. When they talk about what they're learning, I want to actually understand, not just nod politely.

**Curiosity** - If something is helping someone I respect, I want to know what's in there. What wisdom am I missing by dismissing it outright?

**Translation practice** - Can I take religious wisdom and find the secular equivalent? Or does something get lost in translation that I should pay attention to?

**Intellectual honesty** - I've been critical of religion without actually engaging with it seriously. That's lazy. Time to do the work.

## The Translation Challenge

Every morning I read the devotional twice:

**First pass:** Just read it as written. Let the religious language sit there. Don't rush to translate.

**Second pass:** The translation game. When it says "God," what would I say instead? When it talks about prayer, what's my equivalent practice?

Some days the translation is clean:

- "Trust God's plan" → "Focus on influence, not control"
- "Pray without ceasing" → "Practice continuous gratitude"

Other days the translation feels lossy, like I'm missing something essential by removing the divine element. Those are the days I sit with longer.

## Daily Insights

#### October 20th - Seeing His Face

To me this is really about: **Self-compassion/self-acceptance.**

My favorite line in the pasage: **"If God accepts me as I am, I'd better do the same."**

**Important distinction:** Acceptance isn't surrender. It's not "this is who I am and I'll never change." True acceptance means "I accept where I am right now AND I have hope for improvement." (Without the hope part, acceptance becomes resignation - that's bad)

#### October 21st - The Pleasure of God

To me this is really about: **You get to choose if you're happy or miserable - might as well choose happy.**

My favorite line from the passage: **How would you characterize your relationship with God? Cold and sterile? Distant and frustrating? It need not be any of these. It can actually be—dare we suggest it?—fun**

_Here's the tale I use that's coherent with this passage:_

There's this beggar I pass every day. Dirty face, few teeth, hunched over. His life is objectively harder than mine. But he's always got the biggest smile - while I'm usually rushing past in my own head, stressed about nothing.

One day, in an especially foul mood, I stopped. "How are you always so happy?"

He looked me dead in the eye: "Listen man, every day I wake up and choose. Miserable or happy. I choose happy."

**Important distinction:** This isn't toxic positivity or denying real hardship. It's recognizing that even in difficult circumstances, you have agency over your internal state. The beggar's life is still hard - but his choice to face it with happiness doesn't make the hardship disappear, it changes his experience of it.

#### October 22nd - Praying in God's mind

To me this is really about: **Soul-searching to find your essentialist position - and doing it regularly.**

My favorite line from the passage: **"Ask for His wisdom. Pray for His thoughts. Look for a drastic revision to your character and your dreams, and then pray the desires of the new you."**

_Here's how I translate this:_

Prayers for wisdom aren't that different from doing the deep soul-searching to figure out your essentialist position. What actually matters? What's the signal versus the noise? What should I focus on versus politely decline?

It's like my essentialist affirmation - reminding myself what the one thing is that makes everything else easier or unnecessary.

And doing it frequently? That's the do-it-anyway affirmation. Because here's the catch: wisdom keeps changing. What mattered last month might not be the priority this month. Your circumstances shift, you grow, the world changes.

So you can't just figure out your essentialist position once and be done. You have to keep looking for wisdom because it's a moving target.

**Important distinction:** This isn't about being wishy-washy or lacking conviction. It's about recognizing that wisdom is context-dependent. The right answer for yesterday might not be the right answer for today. Regular reflection isn't indecision - it's staying calibrated.

#### October 23rd - Perspective

To me this is really about: **Transcendence - seeing beyond yourself, knowing you're not the center of the universe.**

My favorite line from the passage: **"God helps us have perspective - seeing that we aren't nearly as important as we think."**

_Here's how I translate this:_

When you lose perspective, everything becomes catastrophic. A minor setback feels like the end of the world. A criticism feels like a personal attack. Not getting what you want feels like cosmic injustice.

But perspective - real perspective - is about getting small. It's recognizing that:

- Your problems, while real to you, are a tiny speck in the vastness of time and space
- Most things that feel urgent today won't matter in a year
- You have influence, not control - and exhausting yourself trying to control outcomes beyond your reach is a recipe for burnout

This connects directly to my "Calm Like Water" affirmation: **"Be present, this too shall pass, work the problem."**

The "this too shall pass" part isn't just about time - it's about perspective. Both temporal perspective (it will pass) and cosmic perspective (you're not that important in the grand scheme). When you internalize that, you can actually be present for joy and work the problem analytically instead of catastrophizing.

This is what coherence means in spiritual health - distinguishing your circle of influence from your circle of concern. Perspective lets you focus energy on what you can actually affect, instead of burning out trying to control everything.

**What happens when you lose perspective:**

- Every setback becomes catastrophic
- Pride creeps in - you start believing your importance, your rightness, your specialness
- You burn out trying to control outcomes beyond your influence
- You miss the actual joy and meaning available in the present moment

**Important distinction:** Perspective isn't about minimizing real problems or toxic positivity ("just think positive!"). It's about calibrating the size of your response to the actual size of the problem. A real crisis deserves a crisis response. But not every disappointment is a crisis. Perspective helps you tell the difference.
