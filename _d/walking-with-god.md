Someone important to me has been reading a daily devotional. Even though I'm not religious, I'm studying with them to be able to have conversations about the insights - whether in a secular or religious context. This is my attempt to bridge two worlds: honoring the spiritual wisdom they're finding while translating it into language that works for my engineer brain.

## What Is a Daily Devotional?

A daily devotional is a short reading - usually a page or two - combining scripture, reflection, and prayer. The format is remarkably consistent:

1. **A Bible verse** - the anchor for the day's theme
2. **A story or reflection** - connecting the verse to modern life
3. **A prayer or action step** - making it practical

It's designed to be read first thing in the morning, setting the tone for the day. Think of it as a spiritual vitamin - a small, concentrated dose of meaning before the chaos begins.

## Why I'm Doing This

I'm not doing this to become religious. I'm doing it because:

**Connection** - This person matters to me. When they talk about what they're learning, I want to actually understand, not just nod politely.

**Curiosity** - If something is helping someone I respect, I want to know what's in there. What wisdom am I missing by dismissing it outright?

**Translation practice** - Can I take religious wisdom and find the secular equivalent? Or does something get lost in translation that I should pay attention to?

**Intellectual honesty** - I've been critical of religion without actually engaging with it seriously. That's lazy. Time to do the work.

## The Translation Challenge

Every morning I read the devotional twice:

**First pass:** Just read it as written. Let the religious language sit there. Don't rush to translate.

**Second pass:** The translation game. When it says "God," what would I say instead? When it talks about prayer, what's my equivalent practice?

Some days the translation is clean:

- "Trust God's plan" → "Focus on influence, not control"
- "Pray without ceasing" → "Practice continuous gratitude"

Other days the translation feels lossy, like I'm missing something essential by removing the divine element. Those are the days I sit with longer.

## Daily Insights

_This section will grow as I continue the practice. Each entry captures both the religious wisdom and my secular translation attempts._

#### October 20th - Seeing His Face

To me this is really about: **Self-compassion/self-acceptance.**

My favorite line in the pasage: **"If God accepts me as I am, I'd better do the same."**

**Important distinction:** Acceptance isn't surrender. It's not "this is who I am and I'll never change." True acceptance means "I accept where I am right now AND I have hope for improvement." (Without the hope part, acceptance becomes resignation - that's bad)

#### October 21st - The Pleasure of God

To me this is really about: **You get to choose if you're happy or miserable - might as well choose happy.**

My favorite line from the passage: **"Life sounds hard, but you should really face it with joyfulness, and that'll make it the most fun."**

**The homeless man with the biggest smile:** I walk past this homeless guy every day. No nice clothes, no stuff, no house - his life is objectively harder than most people around him. But he always has the biggest, happiest smile. One day I asked him, "Why are you always so happy?" He looked at me and said, "Well listen man, I have a choice. Every day I can wake up and decide that I'm miserable or that I'm happy. And I'd much rather be happy."

**Important distinction:** This isn't toxic positivity or denying real hardship. It's recognizing that even in difficult circumstances, you have agency over your internal state. The homeless man's life is still hard - but his choice to face it with happiness doesn't make the hardship disappear, it changes his experience of it.
