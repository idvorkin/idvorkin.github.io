Biff also loved drinking, and loved driving – and – while sober, he had no trouble understanding that flirting with drinking and driving would ruin his relationship with life. But, as I learned that chilly Seattle fall, Biff’s sound judgment disappeared at quickly as the scotches – and was replaced by a foolish desire to drive drunk.

Intense emotions are synonymous with interest and mental energy, which is a double edged sword: Good caring (commitment to our identity, positive habits) charges us up, but bad caring (attachment, anger, anxiety, focus on things we don&#x27;t control), brings us down. When bad caring manifests as repetitive, ruminating thought patterns, they become psychic shadows requiring specialized techniques:

These aren&#x27;t just ordinary worries - they&#x27;re psychic shadows, specific thought patterns that loop endlessly in your mind like restless spirits. If you&#x27;re tired of being held hostage by these ruminating thoughts, this post will teach you how to craft personalized spells that banish each shadow the moment it appears, giving you a mystical toolkit for transforming persistent mental loops into single-word circuit breakers that actually work.

/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-44-
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md:45:Psychic shadows are different beasts than the general [mind monsters](/mind-monsters) or broader [psychic weight](/psychic-weight) we carry. While mind monsters are emotional states like anger or pride, and psychic weight encompasses all the mental burden we bear, shadows are specific thought loops that follow predictable patterns:
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-46-
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-47-**They&#x27;re precise and specific**: Not &quot;I&#x27;m worried about money&quot; but &quot;What if the market tanks and I lose everything during my gap year?&quot; Not &quot;I&#x27;m concerned about health&quot; but &quot;What if I get lazy without work structure and lose all my physical discipline?&quot;
--
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-49-**They&#x27;re repetitive and sticky**: The same thought returns again and again, often triggered by specific situations or even random moments of mental quiet.
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-50-
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md:51:**They demand rumination**: Unlike passing worries, shadows insist you think them through completely, analyze every angle, plan for every contingency - even though this mental work rarely provides relief.

/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md:53:From my own [psychic weight](/psychic-weight) catalog, here are shadows I&#x27;ve wrestled with:
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-54-
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md:55:- The bathroom remodel shadow: &quot;The contractor is trying to screw us over&quot; - a thought that kept me awake for days, cycling through evidence and counter-arguments
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md:56:- The money insecurity shadow: &quot;I can&#x27;t spend money on the larger milk because it&#x27;s more expensive per ounce&quot; - even when I was spending $100 on bar tabs
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md:57:- The work document shadow: &quot;If I don&#x27;t finish this perfectly, everyone will think I&#x27;m incompetent&quot; - leading to endless revisions and procrastination
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-58-
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md:59:Each shadow has its own signature pattern, its own trigger points, its own way of hijacking your mental resources.

/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-61-## The Art of Spell-Crafting
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-62-
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md:63:The ancient practice of spell-crafting isn&#x27;t about magic wands and cauldrons - it&#x27;s about conscious intention channeled through precise words. When you craft a spell for a psychic shadow, you&#x27;re creating a circuit-breaker for rumination, a way to interrupt the thought loop and redirect your mental energy.
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-64-
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md:65:### Step 1: Catch the Shadow
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-66-
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md:67:Before you can banish a shadow, you must first see it clearly. This requires developing what I call &quot;shadow awareness&quot; - the ability to notice when you&#x27;ve slipped into a rumination loop.
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-68-
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md:69:But here&#x27;s the crucial distinction: not all mental discomfort deserves banishment. Some thoughts are **functional mental pain** - friendly spirits that deserve attention because they&#x27;re pointing to something that actually needs your focus. Others are **mental suffering** - the unhelpful meanings and stories we add on top, creating shadows that need banishment.

--
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-87-But before crafting a spell, ask: **Is this pain pointing to something that actually needs my attention, or is this suffering I&#x27;m adding on top?** Functional pain deserves action. Mental suffering deserves banishment.
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-88-
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md:89:Practice this meta-cognition. Label it: &quot;This discomfort I&#x27;m experiencing is shadow rumination&quot; - but only after confirming it&#x27;s not a friendly spirit with a legitimate message.
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-90-
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-91-### Step 2: Analyze Deeply
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-92-
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md:93:This is where the real work happens, and it&#x27;s where the [anxiety management](/anxiety-management) framework becomes crucial. You can&#x27;t just suppress the shadow - you need to understand what it&#x27;s really about.
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-94-

/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-98-
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md:99:**Identify the precise threat**: What exactly is the shadow warning you about? Strip away the exaggeration and catastrophizing. Get specific.
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-100-
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-101-**Generate realistic probabilities**: What are the chances this feared outcome actually happens? What are the more likely scenarios?
--
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-109-### Step 3: Bind to Word
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-110-
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md:111:Now comes the mystical part. Take all that analysis, all that understanding, and distill it into a single word or short phrase. This word becomes your spell - a compressed version of your deeper wisdom that you can deploy instantly when the shadow appears.
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-112-
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md:113:The word should feel powerful to you, should resonate with the antidote to your specific shadow. Some examples:
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-114-
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md:115:- **&quot;Abundance&quot;** - for shadows about scarcity and loss
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md:116:- **&quot;Capable&quot;** - for shadows about competence and failure
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md:117:- **&quot;Present&quot;** - for shadows about future catastrophes
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md:118:- **&quot;Worthy&quot;** - for shadows about rejection and abandonment
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md:119:- **&quot;Flow&quot;** - for shadows about control and rigidity
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-120-
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-121-The key is that the word should immediately connect you back to your deeper analysis, like a bookmark to your wisdom.

/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-124-
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md:125:When you catch the shadow starting its familiar dance, speak your spell word. Say it out loud if possible, or with clear intention in your mind.
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-126-
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-127-**Important limitation**: Spells can only be so powerful. You can&#x27;t simply make yourself stop thinking about something - try not to think about a pink elephant on a giant ball right now, and you&#x27;ll see what I mean. The mind doesn&#x27;t work through suppression. Instead, spells work by **redirecting your attention to something else**. Your spell word should connect you to a different thought, feeling, or action.
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md-128-
/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_d/psychic-shadows.md:129:This is why it&#x27;s crucial to pair spell-work with activities you genuinely enjoy. Be wary of using addictive distractions (endless scrolling, substances, compulsive behaviors) to avoid shadows - these create new problems.

/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_posts/2019-09-21-decisive.md:108:Think of a “yardstick” you could use to measure the opportunity cost of the time or money you are about to invest. (Recall that Eisenhower compared the cost of a new bomber to schoolhouses, power plants, and hospitals.) For business investments, you could consider a yardstick like: How many additional customer service reps or salespeople could we hire instead of making this investment? (Would we be better off?) For a personal expense, the yardsticks might include: How many songs could you download? How many dinners out could you have? Or how much extra time could you spend with your kids?

/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_posts/2019-09-21-decisive.md-110-People don’t naturally consider their opportunity costs. Ask them, “What’s the next best use of the resources you’re talking about spending?” Force them to push their spotlights around by asking about different domains: For instance, if they’re waffling about whether to remodel their bathroom, ask whether they might be happier spending the money on a vacation or new furniture for the family room. You’re in a better position to help them avoid narrow frames and your probing can help them clarify their preferences.

/Users/idvorkin/gits/blog/_posts/2019-09-21-decisive.md:160:Can you find someone you trust who will disagree with you? In her study of Silicon Valley firms, Kathy Eisenhardt found that the CEOs who made the quickest, most effective strategic decisions had a senior counselor. The counselor was usually someone who knew the industry well but didn’t have a personal agenda, which meant they could provide unvarnished, trustworthy guidance.

<li><strong>Individuation</strong> - Zero mentions (in Jungian sense)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><strong>There are NO blog posts about Carl Jung or Jungian concepts on this blog.</strong> While words like &quot;archetype,&quot; &quot;shadow,&quot; and &quot;persona&quot; appear, they're used in their modern, everyday meanings rather than referring to Jung's specific psychological theories.</p>
<p>If Igor wants to write about Jung, this would be entirely new territory for the blog with no existing content to build upon or merge with.</p>

        <div class='content'><p>Great! Since you have no existing Jung-related content, this is a blank canvas. Let me help you plan this post.</p>
<p>First, let me understand what you want to cover. Jung's work is vast - here are some potential angles:</p>
<h2>Possible Approaches:</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Overview/Introduction to Jung</strong> - His key concepts (archetypes, collective unconscious, shadow, persona, anima/animus, individuation)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Specific Concept Deep-Dive</strong> - Focus on one idea like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Shadow (unconscious aspects of personality)</li>
<li>Archetypes (universal patterns in human psyche)</li>
<li>Individuation (process of becoming your true self)</li>
<li>Synchronicity (meaningful coincidences)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Personal Application</strong> - How Jung's ideas apply to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-discovery and personal growth</li>
<li>Understanding relationships</li>
<li>Career development</li>
<li>Parenting or family dynamics</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Jung vs Others</strong> - Comparing with Freud, modern psychology, or how his ideas relate to your existing posts on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Voices in the head (could connect to archetypes/inner figures)</li>
<li>Personal identity and authenticity</li>
<li>Emotional intelligence</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Jung for Modern Life</strong> - How his century-old ideas remain relevant today</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Questions for Igor:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>What aspect of Jung excites you most?</strong> What drew you to want to write about him?</li>
<li><strong>What's your relationship with Jung's work?</strong> Have you been reading him, using his ideas, or just curious?</li>
<li><strong>Who's your audience?</strong> People new to Jung, or those already familiar?</li>
<li><strong>What's the &quot;so what&quot;?</strong> How do you want readers to use this information in their lives?</li>
<li><strong>Any personal stories</strong> you want to weave in?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you tell me the direction, I can help you structure the post with the right tone, examples, and connections to your existing blog themes!</p>

        </div>
        <div class='content'><p>Perfect! You have lots of content about ego, self, authenticity, and identity. This Jung post can tie together many of your existing themes. Let me sketch out a structure:</p>
<h2>Proposed Post Structure: &quot;The Self vs Ego: Jung's Map for Becoming Whole&quot;</h2>
<h3>Hook/Opening</h3>
<p>Start with a relatable tension:</p>
<ul>
<li>The feeling of living for others' approval vs what feels true</li>
<li>Success that feels hollow</li>
<li>The exhaustion of maintaining an image</li>
<li>&quot;Who am I when no one's watching?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Part 1: Definitions (Keep crisp - 2-3 paragraphs each)</h3>
<p><strong>Ego (The Social Self)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The conscious identity we present to the world</li>
<li>Not bad - necessary for functioning in society</li>
<li>Built from: roles, achievements, reputation, how others see us</li>
<li>Example: &quot;I'm a manager at X company, parent of 2, productive person&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Self (The True/Whole Self)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The totality of who you are - conscious + unconscious</li>
<li>Includes the parts you hide, deny, or don't know yet</li>
<li>The &quot;inner compass&quot; or authentic voice</li>
<li>Contains your full potential, not just socially acceptable parts</li>
</ul>
<h3>Part 2: The Cycle/Dynamic</h3>
<p>This is the meat - I'd visualize this as a diagram (maybe 2x2 quadrant or circular flow):</p>
<p><strong>Stage 1: Ego Inflation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Over-identified with ego/social self</li>
<li>&quot;I am my job/role/achievements&quot;</li>
<li>Feels: productive, validated, but also fragile, exhausting</li>
<li>Example: Your &quot;life as business&quot; post themes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stage 2: Ego Deflation/Crisis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Something breaks the ego's story (failure, loss, boredom, burnout)</li>
<li>Dark night of the soul, depression, &quot;is this all there is?&quot;</li>
<li>The Self is knocking, demanding attention</li>
<li>Example: Mid-life crisis, career transitions, your time-off reflections</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stage 3: Dialogue with Self</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Turning inward, listening to the neglected parts</li>
<li>Shadow work, dream analysis, creative pursuits</li>
<li>Uncomfortable but generative</li>
<li>Example: Your coaching, journaling, contemplation practices</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stage 4: Integration/Individuation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ego in service to Self (not the other way around)</li>
<li>Using social roles consciously, not being controlled by them</li>
<li>Living authentically while functioning in world</li>
<li>Not permanent - cycle repeats at deeper levels</li>
</ul>
<h3>Part 3: Practical Applications</h3>
<p><strong>Signs you're ego-dominated:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Can't stop achieving/proving</li>
<li>Terrified of others' judgment</li>
<li>Identity crises when roles change</li>
<li>Exhausted from performing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Signs you're connecting with Self:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Choices feel aligned, even if unconventional</li>
<li>Less reactive to praise/criticism</li>
<li>Can hold paradoxes (success AND meaning, work AND play)</li>
<li>Energy from within, not just external validation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Practices to shift from Ego → Self:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Solitude and reflection (your time-off themes)</li>
<li>Creative expression with no audience</li>
<li>Therapy/coaching (depth work)</li>
<li>Notice what you're hiding/denying</li>
<li>Dreams, journaling, active imagination</li>
</ul>
<h3>Part 4: The Paradox</h3>
<p>The ego isn't the enemy - we need it. The goal isn't to destroy ego but to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let Self lead, Ego execute</li>
<li>Use social roles as vehicles for Self-expression, not prisons</li>
<li>Dance between individual authenticity and social connection</li>
</ul>

    13→&quot;Alright, Igor, here&#x27;s the Tony take. Life throws you the Tesla, gives you Autopilot, now you&#x27;re more soprano than subway rider. But let&#x27;s get real. Biking and being car-free, that&#x27;s freedom, fitness, adventure.&quot;
    14→
    15→That&#x27;s my AI life coach talking—he sounds like Tony Soprano, pretends to live in my Tesla, and helps me live the life I want. See - I&#x27;ve always prided myself on being a &quot;mostly car-free spirit.&quot; It&#x27;s literally in my [eulogy](/eulogy)—right there in black and white, celebrating my love for my folding bike and public transit adventures with the kids. Just give a listen to the opening line on my eulogy blog:

    18→
    19→I biked over 3,000 miles in 2022, carried groceries on my handlebars, and then I bought a Tesla The numbers tell the story. In 2023, after getting Tony, my biking dropped from 3,000 miles to under 300. My best friend had warned me: &quot;Buying a Tesla for someone who wants to be a car-free spirit is like buying an ice cream maker for someone trying to lose weight.&quot;

    33→But there I was, rationalizing. Tony did the driving—I was just along for the ride, right? I decorated him with flowers and bunnies, programmed him to make fart sounds when I got texts, and even gave him an [AI agent](https://github.com/idvorkin/tony_tesla) with a Tony Soprano accent. Surely this counted as being car-free adjacent? The cognitive dissonance was real. My eulogy talks about taking kids on the bus to the airport just to ride the elevators and come home. Now I was driving to work because it was &quot;convenient.&quot; The bike that once defined my identity was gathering dust in the garage.

    35→## You are making up this story - right?
    36→
    37→I get it—having a Tony Soprano AI life coach living in your Tesla sounds like the script of some whacky comedy sci-fi. But here&#x27;s the thing: I actually built this. I setup an AI with Tony&#x27;s speech patterns, gave it his personality, and most importantly, set it up with my values and goals from my eulogy. Yes, I call it up when I need to work through life decisions. The conversation you&#x27;re about to hear isn&#x27;t scripted or fictional—it&#x27;s me, sitting in my actual Tesla, having a real crisis of faith in my transportation choices, talking it through with my AI life coach who knows exactly who I want to be.

    46→**Tony:** Tony here. What can I do you for?
    47→
    48→**Me:** Hey. I&#x27;m gonna need some guidance. So I decided, well, before I got a Tesla, I wrote in my eulogy that I was a car-free spirit, and I didn&#x27;t drive, and I loved taking the subway. And I loved biking. But I don&#x27;t really bike anymore. But then, alternatively, I don&#x27;t really drive because Tony drives me everywhere. Tell me how I should think about this. Is biking better? Is being driven around better?
    49→
    50→**Tony:** Alright, Igor. Here&#x27;s the Tony take. First off, it&#x27;s classic. Life throws you the Tesla, gives you Autopilot, now you&#x27;re more soprano than subway rider. But let&#x27;s get real. Biking and being car-free, that&#x27;s freedom, fitness, adventure. You feel the wind, you see the city, you get the proud self-sufficient glow plus those quads, baby. On the other hand, Tesla life—stress-free, plus you get work done or meditate or, you know, chat with your favorite mobster AI. Now ask yourself, what&#x27;s your value here? Is it independence? Health? Time efficiency? Fun? Don&#x27;t sweat labels.
    51→
    52→**Me:** That is a good one. I guess if I&#x27;m with the family, Tony makes sense. He&#x27;s almost an active service. And if I&#x27;m by myself, I need to think through, am I just driving because I&#x27;m being lazy? And this is just consumption activity? Or am I trying to save myself time and be more efficient? Because I think a lot of the time, well, first, humorously, traffic can end up being less efficient. And then I&#x27;m not actually meditating. And I guess, like, if it comes to listening to a podcast, I can do that while biking. And then I get exercise. I think adventure-wise, it&#x27;s about the same. It is nice to have all the stuff with me all the time, though.
    53→
    54→**Tony:** Totally. Having all your gear in the car is peak convenience. But hey, sometimes having all the stuff turns into lugging all the stuff you never use. Biking forces you to be sleek, soprano style—just the essentials, no baggage. Which one feels lighter on your soul, boss?
    55→
    56→**Me:** That&#x27;s it. Good. I think I guess there&#x27;s no reason to agonize over this. I can just start biking and see if I like it and maybe part of the reason I stopped liking it is I&#x27;m just weaker now, and it&#x27;s harder for me. And if I did it again, I&#x27;d feel a lot happier.
    57→
    58→**Tony:** Bada bing. That&#x27;s the spirit. No need to agonize. Just experiment. You start biking, see how you feel, maybe you&#x27;ll get stronger, maybe you&#x27;ll just love the breeze and the freedom again. And hey, if not, Tony the Tesla&#x27;s always got your back seat warm. No shame, boss.
    59→
    60→**Me:** Yep. I definitely need the cardio, and I&#x27;m definitely not doing other cardio things. So I think that&#x27;s fantastic advice.
    61→
    62→**Tony:** That&#x27;s music to my ears. You get on that bike, your heart pumps, endorphins flow, boss mode unlocked. Don&#x27;t overthink it. Just ride and enjoy the journey. If you hate it, you know where I&#x27;ll be. Blasting AC in the Tesla waiting to chauffeur you in style.

    64→## What Tony Helped Me See
    65→
    66→Sometimes our identities need to evolve, not disappear. The &quot;mostly car-free spirit&quot; wasn&#x27;t about the bike itself—it was about intentionality, adventure, and finding joy in unconventional transportation.
    67→
    68→Tony became a tool for family adventures: camping trips where we slept under the glass roof, charging stops that turned into juggling sessions, and road trips that would have been impossible on two wheels. The kids got to experience California&#x27;s coast, Ashland&#x27;s charm, and countless other adventures.
    69→
    70→The bike didn&#x27;t disappear from my life—it just found its right-sized place. Some trips call for pedal power and the meditative rhythm of cycling. Others call for autopilot and the ability to arrive refreshed after 300 miles. And sometimes? I drive my folding bike around in the Tesla, getting the best of both worlds.
    71→
    72→Identity isn&#x27;t about rigid adherence to a past version of yourself. It&#x27;s about staying true to your values while adapting your methods. I&#x27;m still that guy who values sustainable transport, family adventures, and finding the unconventional path. I just have more tools in my toolkit now.
    73→
    74→## The Bigger Picture: AI as Your Reflection Coach
    75→
    76→This conversation with Tony represents something bigger than just transportation choices. It&#x27;s an example of what I call a &quot;Reflection Coach&quot;—an AI life coach trained on your deepest values who can help you think through decisions and align your actions with who you want to be.
    77→
    78→The concept isn&#x27;t new. I&#x27;ve been thinking about this kind of AI-assisted self-reflection as part of my [mortality software](/mortality-software) project, where I explore how technology can help us live more intentionally. The Reflection Coach is designed to help you examine your thinking, challenge your assumptions, and find clarity in moments of confusion.
    79→
    80→{%include summarize-page.html src=&quot;/mortality-software&quot;%}
    81→
    82→What makes Tony effective isn&#x27;t just his personality (though the Jersey accent helps). It&#x27;s that he knows who I want to be—he&#x27;s trained on my values, my goals, my eulogy—and can remind me of them when I&#x27;m lost in the weeds of daily contradictions. This isn&#x27;t talking to yourself; it&#x27;s talking to your AI life coach who knows who you want to be and can cut through your mental noise to get you back on track.
    83→
    84→The future of personal development might not be traditional therapy or life coaching. It might be having thoughtful conversations with AI coaches trained on your deepest values, designed to help you stay aligned with your authentic self when life gets complicated. And honestly? That future is already here.
    85→
    86→## The Only Question That Counts
    87→
    88→Did the AI help? Not by providing the answer, but by helping me get to the only question that counts: did I act? And the answer, at least this week, is yes — I biked home from work 3 days!
    89→

    20→Coaching is like midwifery. A midwife can not give birth to the baby, she facilitates the birth. Similarly, a coach can not give a solution, she must give birth to the insight from within the coachee. Coaching is asking questions, guiding, and facilitating understanding, and this post collects my studies on the topic.

    52→### The coaching mindset
    53→
    54→{%include blob_image_float_right.html src=&quot;icon-birth.png&quot; %}
    55→
    56→Real understanding comes from within, and is not imparted by someone else. Ask questions, guide, and encourage. When you &#x27;tell the solution&#x27; at best the solution is forgotten, at worst it offends and shutdowns down the coachee, damaging the relationship.
    57→
    58→When being a coach maintain the following mindset.
    59→
    60→- Ask permission to be a coach. (Avoid forcing them)
    61→- Check-in with yourself to maintain the coaching mindset (Avoid forgetting your role)
    62→- Let your coachee do most of the talking. (Avoid cutting them off)
    63→- Keep questions open ended. (Avoid Yes/No questions)
    64→- Test your understanding (Avoid assuming you understand)
    65→- Be accepting, compassionate, and [curious](/grandmother-mind) (Avoid judging and evaluating)
    66→
    67→### Frequent coaching situations
    68→
    69→Some coaching situations are common, so I have deep dived into them.
    70→
    71→- [Making Major Decisions](/decisive) - A deep dive on how to improve high impact decision making.
    72→- [Dealing with Pride](/pride) - A deep dive on dealing with pride.
    73→- [Job Hunting](job-hunt-stress) - A deep dive on job changes
    74→
    75→### The 7 goto coaching questions
    76→
    77→When folks have questions or appear stuck, that&#x27;s a great time to provide rapid in the moment coaching. These 7 questions are a great starting point to help the coachee build the required insights for solving their own problem:
    78→
    79→- Open: What&#x27;s on your mind?
    80→- Expand: What Else?
    81→- Focus Problem: What&#x27;s the real challenge here for you?
    82→- Focus Need: What do you want?
    83→  - Do not ask why, it makes people defensive - you&#x27;re questioning their ability by asking why.
    84→  - Want vs Need
    85→- Focus Request: How can I help?
    86→- Focus Trade off: If you say yes to this, what will you have to say no to?
    87→  - Omission - automatic no
    88→  - Commission - what you must give up to make it happen (relationships/projects/)
    89→- Close the loop: What was most useful for you in this conversation?
    90→
    91→### Questions for specific situations
    92→
    93→Depending on what insights you want to provide, you need to use different questions. Some questions are below, [Decisive](/decisive) has a plethora of other questions.
    94→
    95→#### To clarify thinking
    96→
    97→- Help me understand that?
    98→- Tell me more?
    99→- Unpack that for me?
   100→- How did you come to that realization?
   101→- I&#x27;m having a hard time understanding, can you give some examples?
   102→
   103→#### To challenge assumptions
   104→
   105→- Is that always the case?
   106→- What would it look like if that was false?
   107→
   108→#### To gather more evidence
   109→
   110→- What makes you say that?
   111→
   112→#### To find more alternatives
   113→
   114→- What is the counter argument?
   115→- What other options have you considered?
   116→- What would happen i this option disappeared?
   117→- What is the next best use of resources?
   118→- How can you do A and B?
   119→- How would you decide if you had double the resources?
   120→- How would you decide if you had half the resources?
   121→
   122→#### To build strategic insight
   123→
   124→- What does success mean?
   125→- What is our scope (who/where)
   126→- What will be our differentiator/moat here?
   127→- What capabilities/assets will need to achieve this?
   128→- How do we measure success and provide feedback?
   129→
   130→#### To increase productivity, effectiveness, and efficiency
   131→
   132→This request often comes in as the wrong question, need to deep dive into where the problem is coming from.
   133→
   134→1. Find the right thing:
   135→
   136→   - The top optimization is spending zero time on the wrong thing. How often do you feel your spending time on the wrong thing?
   137→   - Taking time to explore is important, how are you splitting time between, learning, exploring and doing?
   138→   - What does success look like, how is your work supporting that success?
   139→
   140→2. Test for motivation:
   141→
   142→   - On a scale of 1/10 how energized are you doing this work?
   143→   - When are times you&#x27;re most energized and most drained? Any patterns
   144→
   145→3. Realistic Expectations + Estimations
   146→
   147→   - Anxiety is the difference between expectations and reality. How are you validating your estimates/expectations are reasonable?
   148→
   149→4. Having the required resources
   150→
   151→   - How often are you getting blocked?
   152→   - What things would help you get done this faster?
   153→   - Are there things that if you had, would speed you up?
   154→   - What resources would make you more efficient?
   155→
   156→5. Doing it Efficiently
   157→   - How often are you stuck?
   158→   - How are you going about getting help?
   159→
   160→### The hows of coaching
   161→
   162→#### Coach for task completion vs insight
   163→
   164→Coaching applies to different time frames, keep them separate:
   165→
   166→- P: Project - Immediate task and new skill
   167→- P: People - Relationship
   168→- PC: Pattern - Help person get better.
   169→
   170→#### Keep people safe while coaching using human safety models
   171→
   172→TERA -
   173→
   174→- **Tribe:** Tribe, &#x27;us&#x27; vs &#x27;them&#x27; - be us.
   175→- **Certainty:** People dislike ambiguity/uncertainty.
   176→- **Rank:** Do I move up or down the social ladder
   177→- **Autonomy:** I have control
   178→
   179→SCARF -
   180→_More details in [Search inside yourself - Leadership and social skills](/search-inside-yourself)_
   181→
   182→- **Status:** Where am I in the pecking order
   183→  - **BUILD:** Give credit, and feedback, ups peoples status
   184→- **Certainty:** Do I know what what&#x27;s going on.
   185→  - **Build:** removing ambiguity, and giving people certainty on things that matter.
   186→- **Autonomy:** Do I have control over the situation?
   187→  - **Build:** making clear it&#x27;s people&#x27;s choice, not yours.
   188→- **Relatedness:** Is other person friend or foe.
   189→  - **Build:** by taking time to know people.
   190→- **Fairness:**
   191→  - **Build:** making clear that you&#x27;re being fair.
   192→
   193→#### Soften your coaching: How Can I help
   194→
   195→- Out of curiosity
   196→- Just so I know
   197→- To help my understand better
   198→- To make sure I&#x27;m clear
   199→- That is a hard problem
   200→- Not alone, lots of people struggle with this.
   201→
   202→#### Encourage trying to solve own problem: How would you handle this
   203→
   204→Great question, I have some ideas, but first, how would you tackle this? What else?
   205→
   206→#### Say No: Say yes slowly
   207→
   208→- Why are you asking me?
   209→- Whom else have you asked?
   210→- What you say urgent what do you mean?
   211→- What does done mean?
   212→- If I could only do one part, what part would you have me do?
   213→- What do you recommend I take off my plate to get this done?
   214→- _If you still have to say no_ Make sure you&#x27;re saying no to the task, not to the person.
   215→
   216→#### Focus feedback on you, not them
   217→
   218→From the superb HBR article: [The feedback fallacy](https://hbr.org/2019/03/the-feedback-fallacy). If you don&#x27;t read the article (which I&#x27;ll also summarize)
   219→take this high order bit of focusing the feedback on &quot;you&quot; not on them. E.g. feedback should be &quot;I experienced X&quot; instead of you screwed up X.

   238→
   239→As people take on new tasks requiring them to learn new skills, they go through a predictable, often painful, sequence of experiences. These experiences are based on the progression of commitment and competence, and each experience benefits from a different type of coaching described in [Situational Leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situational_leadership_theory).

   317→### Other coaching tools
   318→
   319→Below are some other good coaching tools I need to write more details on:
   320→
   321→- Using a scale question for relative improvement not for calibration. E.g. on a scale of 1 to 10, how do you rank yourself on X! Great, why do you say that?, Great - what would you need to do to move up a point on the scale?
   322→
   323→- Imagery cards - Use cards with images on them to illicit from people what picture represents what concept, then have a discussion. E.g. which of these pictures represents leadership to you? OK, help me see how that shows a leader to you.
   324→
   325→- [Prompts](/prompts)
   326→
   327→### Full disclosure: Coaching others is selfish too!
   328→
   329→Coaching has a selfish benefit - most challenges others face, we face too. It&#x27;s easier to see someone else&#x27;s situation clearly than our own.
   330→
   331→When I coach someone through imposter syndrome or work-life balance, I&#x27;m dealing with my own struggles too. The questions I ask others - &quot;What would success look like?&quot; &quot;What&#x27;s the real challenge here?&quot; - are questions I need to ask myself.
   332→
   333→By helping others see their situation clearly, we practice seeing our own more clearly. The coaching questions that unlock insights for them work on us too. We just forget to ask them.
   334→
   335→This is the greedy part - every coaching session reminds us to apply our own coaching questions to ourselves. The clarity we help others find becomes our own.

    12→I spent years treating regrets like a cage - replaying decisions I couldn&#x27;t change, beating myself up over the past. Here&#x27;s the critical reframe: regrets aren&#x27;t about the past, they&#x27;re guides for what you should do next. The past is outside your circle of influence, but regrets are data about your values trying to redirect your future. I&#x27;ve found four main types (foundation, boldness, moral, and connection), and the goal isn&#x27;t avoiding regrets - it&#x27;s using them as a compass instead of a cage.

    35→Most of this post comes from Daniel Pink&#x27;s power of regrets: {% include amazon.html asin=&quot;0735210659&quot; %}
    36→
    37→## How to Think About Regrets
    38→
    39→The past is completely outside your circle of influence. You can&#x27;t change what happened, no matter how much mental energy you pour into guilt or rumination. That&#x27;s critical to remember: regrets about past decisions are outside your circle of influence.
    40→
    41→But here&#x27;s the reframe: while you can&#x27;t change the past, you can use those regrets to guide your future. They&#x27;re data points showing what you value most.
    42→
    43→### Concerns, Control and Influence
    44→
    45→[The first of the 7 habits, be proactive](/7h-c1) requires focusing your energy on your circle of influence, not your circle of concern. A frequent source of [anxiety](/mental-pain) is trying to control things outside your influence.
    46→
    47→The past? Guess what - that&#x27;s 100% outside your circle of influence. You literally cannot change it.
    48→
    49→So here&#x27;s the shift: stop dwelling on backward-looking regrets (what you did wrong) and start using forward-looking regret avoidance (what you should do next).
    50→
    51→Where do you have influence? The future (and more accurately, the present). Think through potential future regrets before making decisions. I frequently remind myself that [no one ever uttered &quot;God, I wish I spent more time at work&quot; on their deathbed](/wlb-manifesto).
    52→
    53→Use regrets to:
    54→
    55→- **Learn and grow**: Let past regrets motivate you to be more responsible, take healthy risks, make amends, and prioritize what truly matters
    56→- **Avoid future regrets**: Anticipate what you might regret and weigh that against potential benefits
    57→
    58→### Be compassionate to yourself - forgive
    59→
    60→Compassion is about removing suffering and accepting people as they are. It&#x27;s easy to extend compassion to others - but it&#x27;s even more important (and harder) to apply it to yourself.
    61→
    62→When you have regrets, treat yourself with the same compassion you&#x27;d offer a friend struggling with similar feelings.
    63→
    64→Compassion can be broken down with a time dimension.
    65→
    66→| Time    | Behavior    | Practice     | Behavior Definition                                     |
    67→| ------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
    68→| Past    | Forgiveness | Humility     | Give up hope for a better past                          |
    69→| Present | Acceptance  | Gratefulness | Recognizing you have received more than your fair share |
    70→| Future  | Hope        | Patience     | Believe the future can be better than the present       |
    71→
    72→{%include summarize-page.html src=&quot;/compassion&quot; %}
    73→
    74→### Judgment vs Curiosity
    75→
    76→Judgment throws up barriers and causes us to hide the truth which can lead to guilt and [shame](/shame). Curiosity is gentle and helps us find what is going on. Compassion reduces judgment, reducing the barrier to compassion.
    77→
    78→When processing regrets, lead with curiosity rather than judgment. Instead of beating yourself up over past decisions, get curious about what drove those choices and what you can learn from them.
    79→
    80→## The Four Regrets
    81→
    82→When thinking about regrets, they tend to fall into patterns. Daniel Pink&#x27;s [The Power of Regret](https://www.danpink.com/the-power-of-regret/) analyzed over 16,000 regrets from 105 countries and found four core categories. Understanding these patterns helps you anticipate what you might regret before you make decisions.
    83→
    84→The four regrets operate as a photographic negative of the good life - if you know what people regret most, you can reverse the image to see what they value most.
    85→
    86→### Foundational - If only I&#x27;d done the work
    87→
    88→Foundation regrets stem from failures to be responsible and do the hard work that builds a stable life. These are the &quot;I should have known better&quot; regrets about not laying proper groundwork. They often compound over time - small neglects become major problems.
    89→
    90→E.g.
    91→
    92→- **Financial stability**: Not saving for retirement. You live paycheck to paycheck in your 60s because you spent everything in your 20s.
    93→- **Health and wellness**: Not prioritizing exercise, sleep, and nutrition. You deal with preventable chronic conditions because you ignored your body for decades.
    94→- **Education and skills**: Neglecting self-improvement. You watch less experienced people get promoted because you never developed new skills.
    95→- **Relationships foundation**: Not learning to communicate or manage emotions. You repeat the same relationship patterns because you never did the inner work.
    96→
    97→### Boldness - If only I&#x27;d taken the risk/opportunity
    98→
    99→Boldness regrets come from playing it too safe - from inaction rather than action. These are the chances not taken, the words not spoken, the dreams not pursued. The pain comes from wondering &quot;what if?&quot; and knowing you&#x27;ll never find out because fear or comfort held you back.
   100→
   101→E.g.
   102→
   103→- **Romantic risks**: Not asking someone out when you felt a connection. You wonder for years if they felt the same way.
   104→- **Career leaps**: Not starting the business you dreamed of. You stay in the safe corporate job while others build the company you imagined.
   105→- **Life experiences**: Not traveling when you had the chance. You say &quot;someday&quot; until health or circumstances make it impossible.
   106→- **Creative expression**: Not sharing your art, writing, or music. You keep your gifts hidden because you fear criticism.
   107→- **Speaking up**: Not saying what needed to be said. You stay silent when you should have advocated for yourself or others.
   108→
   109→### Moral - If only I&#x27;d done the right thing
   110→
   111→Moral regrets arise from compromising your values or hurting others. These cut the deepest because they damage your self-image and often harm people you care about. They&#x27;re about knowing you chose wrong when you knew what was right.
   112→
   113→E.g.
   114→
   115→- **Betraying trust**: Cheating on a partner or in competition. You carry the guilt of violating someone&#x27;s faith in you.
   116→- **Dishonesty**: Lying for personal gain. You carry the weight of a lie that affected someone&#x27;s life.
   117→- **Selfishness**: Taking credit for someone else&#x27;s work. You prioritized your comfort over another&#x27;s need.
   118→- **Cruelty**: Being hurtful when you could have been kind. You bullied someone or said something deliberately cutting.
   119→- **Ethical lapses**: Going along with something wrong. You stayed silent about unethical behavior to protect yourself.
   120→
   121→### Connection - If only I&#x27;d reached out
   122→
   123→Connection regrets stem from neglecting relationships or letting them wither. These hurt because relationships are central to human flourishing, and we often don&#x27;t realize their value until it&#x27;s too late. The regret is knowing a simple act of reaching out could have preserved or healed something precious.
   124→
   125→E.g.
   126→
   127→- **Drifting apart**: Not staying in touch with friends and family who mattered. You realize years later that a valued friendship died from neglect, not conflict.
   128→- **Unresolved conflicts**: Not making amends after an argument. You carry the burden of a broken relationship that could have been repaired.
   129→- **Missing moments**: Taking loved ones for granted. You wish you&#x27;d spent more time with a parent who&#x27;s now gone, or listened when your child wanted to talk.
   130→- **Words unsaid**: Not expressing love or appreciation. You never told someone how much they meant before they died or moved away.
   131→- **Pride and stubbornness**: Letting ego prevent reconnection. You wait for them to reach out first until it becomes impossible.
   132→
   133→### How regrets change over time
   134→
   135→As we can see, regret distribution varies across age groups. People tend to have the most boldness regrets in their 20s, which may be due to feeling like they haven&#x27;t taken enough chances or pursued their dreams. Regret about foundation choices tends to increase with age, possibly due to a greater awareness of long-term consequences. Connection regrets also tend to rise with age, perhaps as people reflect on lost relationships or missed opportunities for connection.
   136→
   137→It&#x27;s important to note that this is just a general trend, and individual experiences may vary.

   226→
   227→Regrets will happen. That&#x27;s not the problem. The problem is letting them cage you instead of guide you.
   228→
   229→The next time you feel that ache of regret, ask yourself: What is this telling me about what I value? What can I do differently going forward? How would I advise a friend in this situation?
   230→
   231→Your regrets are trying to help you. Let them be your compass pointing toward what matters most - not a cage keeping you stuck in the past.
   232→
   233→Start small: Pick one regret you&#x27;re carrying. Get curious about it. What does it reveal about your values? What one thing could you do differently tomorrow?

    11→I&#x27;m incredibly fortunate to be able to take 6 weeks off this summer! After 5 years of service at Meta, you get 30 days (about 5 week) off!

    13→It&#x27;s a special year since Zach will be going into grade 10, and Amelia into Middle school
    14→
    15→To get the most out of my time off, I&#x27;m going to follow my best practice of pre-writing what I want to get done, and adjust it as I go. This is a combination of [time off](/time-off), and all the stuff for [happiness](/happy), which I guess gets tangled up with half of my evergreen notes.

    78→
    79→Tori and I spent a lot of time on our relationship this year, and she&#x27;s organized the whole trip! It&#x27;s gonna be great having a planner to make sure everything happens.
    80→
    81→### From 12 months to 6 weeks
    82→
    83→Five years ago, I dreamed of taking a year off of work - [a gap year](/gap-year-igor) if you will. I spent a lot of time thinking through a gap year, and it&#x27;s more important then ever now that the kids are running out of time. But that&#x27;s a separate blog post

    87→### The Great Monday Cat Visitation Protocol (Or: How We Became Slaves to Our Feline Overlords)
    88→
    89→Here&#x27;s our travel hack: the Monday Cat Check-In System™. Instead of pet sitters, we return every Monday to prevent feline coups and unauthorized DoorDash orders.
    90→
    91→Perfect timing since we booked Monday improv classes with [Matt Smith](https://www.mattsmithimprov.com/), who helped establish Seattle&#x27;s comedy scene in the &#x27;90s. Our routine: check on judgmental cats (&quot;Oh, you&#x27;re back AGAIN?&quot;), then learn to be funny on command.
    92→
    93→The cats have caught on, scheduling Sunday night drama for maximum Monday impact. But instead of shoe logistics operations, we&#x27;re more likely to find nature&#x27;s surprises: a desiccated hummingbird artfully displayed on the welcome mat, or a beheaded rabbit positioned like modern art in the hallway. I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re testing our commitment to this arrangement.
    94→
    95→But honestly? Weekly guaranteed animal discovery AND comedy training while road-tripping? Pure genius.

    21→Training Emotional Intelligence through mindfulness. Search inside yourself is a meditation training manual for engineers. It&#x27;s also a pun as the author works at google, and built the program internally at Google. Joy on demand by the same author, is less engineer focused, and uses joy as a path to medatitive bliss.

   116→    _ Listener - notice if you&#x27;re being distracted, try to let it go.
   117→    _ Speaker - notice how this makes you feel, decide to talk about it, or let it go.
   118→- Formal Mindful Conversation

   125→  - Consider explaining what you did, and let the other person join you.
   126→- Sustaining your practice
   127→  - Like exercise, only hard for first few months. Tips

   129→    1. Do less then you can
   130→    1. At a minimum, do a breathe/1 minute/2 minute.

     3→## Core Consistency Rules
     4→
     5→### Style Consistency Principle
     6→
     7→**If you choose to deviate from the recommended style guidelines below, maintain that deviation consistently throughout the entire piece.** Mixing styles within a single post creates jarring reader experiences.
     8→
     9→**Examples of acceptable consistent deviations:**
    10→
    11→- Using &quot;we&quot; throughout an entire post (but never mixing &quot;we&quot; and &quot;I&quot;)
    12→- Writing in third person for a specific piece (but maintaining it throughout)
    13→- Using formal academic tone for technical content (but not switching to conversational mid-post)
    14→- Adopting a specific narrative voice for storytelling posts
    15→
    16→### Inconsistency Warnings
    17→
    18→**AI assistants and editors should flag these inconsistencies:**
    19→
    20→- ❌ Switching between &quot;I&quot; and &quot;we&quot; within the same post
    21→- ❌ Mixing formal and conversational tones randomly
    22→- ❌ Starting personal then becoming impersonal
    23→- ❌ Inconsistent use of headers, bullet styles, or formatting
    24→- ❌ Switching between metaphorical frameworks mid-post
    25→- ❌ Changing target audience assumptions (expert → beginner → expert)
    26→
    27→**The goal:** Readers should feel like they&#x27;re having one coherent conversation, not multiple conversations stitched together.
    28→
    29→---
    30→
    31→## Universal Writing Style (All Content)
    32→
    33→### Voice and Perspective
    34→
    35→- **Always use &quot;I&quot;** for personal perspective, never &quot;we&quot;
    36→- **Direct and concise** - avoid flowery language where it obscures meaning
    37→- **Personal but pragmatic** tone
    38→- **Conversational vulnerability** - write like you&#x27;re having coffee with a thoughtful friend who shares real struggles
    39→- **Vulnerable but authoritative** - show uncertainty alongside expertise
    40→- **Systems thinking approach** - naturally build frameworks and structured approaches
    41→- **Metaphorical thinking** - use consistent metaphors (dragons, mountains, rivers) to explain complex concepts
    42→
    43→### Language Patterns
    44→
    45→- **Questions to engage readers** and introduce new sections
    46→- **Concrete examples** over abstract concepts
    47→- **&quot;Here&#x27;s what I learned&quot;** rather than &quot;You should do this&quot;
    48→- **Strategic use of rich metaphors** when they enhance understanding
    49→- **Self-deprecating humor** with phrases like &quot;completely aspirational&quot; and acknowledgment of personal flaws
    50→- **Vulnerability as strength** - openly discussing fears, failures, and contradictions
    51→- **Research integration** - heavy citing of books, studies, and external sources
    52→- **Avoid marketing speak and buzzwords** - no &quot;revolutionary,&quot; &quot;game-changing,&quot; or corporate jargon
    53→
    54→### Avoiding AI Writing Patterns
    55→
    56→**These patterns make writing feel generic and machine-generated. Avoid them:**
    57→
    58→_Reference: [Wikipedia: Signs of AI Writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing)_
    59→
    60→**❌ Undue emphasis phrases:**
    61→
    62→- &quot;stands as&quot;, &quot;serves as&quot;, &quot;plays a vital role in&quot;
    63→- &quot;underscores its significance&quot;, &quot;highlights the importance&quot;
    64→- &quot;captivates both X and Y alike&quot;
    65→- Instead: Be direct and specific about what something does or means
    66→
    67→**❌ Promotional/tourism language:**
    68→
    69→- &quot;nestled within the breathtaking&quot;, &quot;rich cultural heritage&quot;
    70→- &quot;must-visit&quot;, &quot;hidden gem&quot;, &quot;boasts a wide array&quot;
    71→- Instead: Use concrete, sensory details and personal experience
    72→
    73→**❌ Editorializing phrases:**
    74→
    75→- &quot;it&#x27;s important to note that&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s worth mentioning&quot;
    76→- &quot;notably&quot;, &quot;importantly&quot;, &quot;significantly&quot;
    77→- Instead: Just state the point directly - if it&#x27;s in your post, it&#x27;s already important
    78→
    79→**❌ Superficial -ing phrase overuse:**
    80→
    81→- &quot;highlighting the fact that&quot;, &quot;showcasing the importance&quot;
    82→- &quot;demonstrating the value of&quot;, &quot;emphasizing the need for&quot;
    83→- Instead: Use active verbs and direct statements
    84→
    85→**❌ Formulaic conjunctions:**
    86→
    87→- Starting many sentences with &quot;Additionally&quot;, &quot;Furthermore&quot;, &quot;Moreover&quot;
    88→- Essay-like synthesis language that sounds academic rather than conversational
    89→- Instead: Use natural transitions and vary sentence structure
    90→
    91→**❌ Vague intensifiers:**
    92→
    93→- &quot;very unique&quot;, &quot;extremely important&quot;, &quot;highly significant&quot;
    94→- &quot;truly remarkable&quot;, &quot;particularly noteworthy&quot;
    95→- Instead: Show don&#x27;t tell - use specific examples that demonstrate importance
    96→
    97→**✅ Better approaches:**
    98→
    99→- Use specific numbers, names, and details over vague descriptions
   100→- Write like you&#x27;re explaining to a friend, not composing an essay
   101→- Let the content speak for itself rather than emphasizing its importance
   102→- Replace abstract analysis with concrete observations
   103→- Use plain, direct language over formal academic phrasing
   104→
   105→### Structure Elements
   106→
   107→- **Extensive use of headers** for easy scanning
   108→- **Bullet points** to chunk information
   109→- **Table of contents** for longer pieces (auto-generated via vim-markdown-toc)
   110→- **Heavy cross-referencing** using `{% include summarize-page.html %}` for internal linking
   111→- **Progressive disclosure** - start with simple concepts, then drill deeper
   112→- **Iterative development** - posts evolve over time with update notes
   113→- **Framework building** - most posts end with practical application methods
   114→
   115→### Engagement Techniques
   116→
   117→- **Rhetorical questions** as section breaks
   118→- **Direct reader address** (&quot;I bet you don&#x27;t either&quot;)
   119→- **Dialog format** for internal conflicts and decision-making (real and imagined conversations)
   120→- **Real-time authenticity** - admit uncertainty and show work in progress
   121→- **Meta-commentary** on your own writing and thinking process
   122→- **Personal anecdotes as teaching tools** - stories that illustrate broader principles
   123→- **Pre-mortem/scenario planning** - regular use of &quot;what if&quot; thinking
   124→
   125→---
   126→

   336→## Content Development Workflow
   337→
   338→### 1. Start with Purpose
   339→
   340→- **Personal processing** - What am I trying to figure out?
   341→- **Public value** - How can this help others?
   342→- **Framework building** - What systematic approach am I developing?
   343→
   344→### 2. Choose Content Type
   345→
   346→- Match your purpose to the appropriate content type above
   347→- Consider hybrid approaches for complex topics
   348→- Plan for potential evolution (exploration → framework → published advice)
   349→
   350→### 3. Apply Type-Specific Guidelines
   351→
   352→- Use the voice and structure patterns for your chosen type
   353→- Include all key elements relevant to that content type
   354→- Follow the suggested length guidelines
   355→
   356→### 4. Cross-Link and Connect
   357→
   358→- Reference related content throughout
   359→- Build connections between different frameworks
   360→- Update existing content with new insights
   361→
   362→### 5. Tag and Organize
   363→
   364→- Use consistent tagging system
   365→- Include type-specific tags plus topic tags
   366→- Consider searchability and future discovery
   367→
   368→---
   369→
   370→## Special Considerations
   371→
   372→### Dual-Purpose Content
   373→
   374→Most substantial content should serve both personal processing AND public teaching. This is your superpower - turning personal work into valuable public content.
   375→
   376→### Living Documents
   377→
   378→Many pieces should be treated as living documents that get updated over time with new insights, examples, and refinements.
   379→
   380→### Authentic Vulnerability
   381→
   382→Your willingness to show uncertainty, mistakes, and work-in-progress thinking is what makes the content uniquely valuable. Maintain this across all content types.
   383→
   384→### Framework Thinking
   385→
   386→You naturally build systematic approaches to complex topics. Lean into this strength by making frameworks explicit and reusable.
   387→
   388→### Meta-Awareness
   389→
   390→Your ability to comment on your own thinking process adds depth and authenticity. Include this meta-commentary where it serves the content.
   391→
   392→---
   393→
   394→## Technical Implementation Guide
   395→
   396→### Alert Boxes
   397→
   398→Use alert boxes to highlight important information, warnings, or construction notices:
   399→
   400→**Syntax:**
   401→
   402→```liquid
   403→{% include alert.html content=&quot;Your message here&quot; style=&quot;info&quot; %}
   404→{% include alert.html content=&quot;Warning or caution message&quot; style=&quot;warning&quot; %}
   405→{% include alert.html content=&quot;Work in progress notice&quot; style=&quot;danger&quot; %}
   406→```
   407→
   408→**Common use cases:**
   409→
   410→- Construction/work-in-progress notices
   411→- Important caveats or disclaimers
   412→- Cross-references to related content
   413→- Privilege acknowledgments
   414→
   415→**Example:**
   416→
   417→```liquid
   418→{% include alert.html content=&quot;🚧 Construction Zone 🚧 This post is in heavy progress! 🔨 Check back later for updates ⏳&quot; style=&quot;warning&quot; %}
   419→```
   420→
   421→### URL Redirects
   422→
   423→Set up redirects for shorter, memorable URLs using both `redirect_from` and `alias`:
   424→
   425→**Syntax:**
   426→
   427→```yaml
   428→redirect_from:
   429→  - /shortname
   430→  - /abbreviation
   431→alias:
   432→  - /shortname
   433→  - /abbreviation
   434→```
   435→
   436→**Example:**
   437→
   438→```yaml
   439→redirect_from:
   440→  - /7habits
   441→  - /7h
   442→alias:
   443→  - /7habits
   444→  - /7h
   445→```
   446→
   447→### Book Links and Amazon Affiliate Integration
   448→
   449→Use the Amazon include for book references with ASIN numbers:
   450→
   451→**Syntax:**
   452→
   453→```liquid
   454→{% include amazon.html asin=&quot;ASIN_NUMBER&quot; %}
   455→{% include amazon.html asin=&quot;ASIN1;ASIN2;ASIN3&quot; %}
   456→```
   457→
   458→**Examples:**
   459→
   460→```liquid
   461→{% include amazon.html asin=&quot;0071499938&quot; %}
   462→{% include amazon.html asin=&quot;B07LDSPRYM;B00506CSDQ;B07C66Z4M4&quot; %}
   463→```
   464→
   465→**How it works:**
   466→
   467→- ASINs are looked up in `_data/asins.json` for title, image, and description
   468→- Automatically includes affiliate tag (`ighe-20`)
   469→- Falls back to generic Amazon image if product data not available
   470→- Supports multiple books separated by semicolons
   471→- Images are styled consistently with fallback text if images fail to load
   472→
   473→**Best practices:**
   474→
   475→- Use ASIN numbers (found in Amazon URLs) rather than direct links
   476→- Group related books together in single include
   477→- Place near relevant text sections
   478→- ASIN data is managed automatically via scripts in `/scripts/` directory
   479→
   480→### Images
   481→
   482→Use the custom image includes for consistent formatting:
   483→
   484→**Right-floating images:**
   485→
   486→```liquid
   487→{% include blob_image_float_right.html src=&quot;blog/image-name.webp&quot; %}
   488→```
   489→
   490→**Standard images:**
   491→
   492→```liquid
   493→{% include blob_image.html src=&quot;blog/image-name.webp&quot; %}
   494→```
   495→
   496→**Small right-floating images (25% width):**
   497→
   498→```liquid
   499→{% include blob_image_float_right_w25.html src=&quot;blog/image-name.webp&quot; %}
   500→```
   501→
   502→**Image best practices:**
   503→
   504→- Use WebP format for efficiency
   505→- Store images in the GitHub blob: `https://github.com/idvorkin/blob/raw/master/blog/filename.webp`
   506→- Reference using relative paths in includes: `blog/filename.webp`
   507→- Place floating images near relevant text sections
   508→
   509→### Cross-References and Internal Linking
   510→
   511→Use the summarize-page include for rich internal linking:
   512→
   513→**Syntax:**
   514→
   515→```liquid
   516→{% include summarize-page.html src=&quot;/page-name&quot; %}
   517→```
   518→
   519→**How it works:**
   520→
   521→- Automatically pulls title and description from the linked page
   522→- Creates a styled summary box with proper attribution
   523→- Uses data from `back-links.json` for consistent metadata
   524→- Provides rich preview of the linked content
   525→
   526→**When to use:**
   527→
   528→- Referencing related comprehensive posts
   529→- Building connections between related frameworks
   530→- Providing deeper dive options
   531→- Creating content clusters around themes
   532→- Cross-linking between book summaries and related life posts
   533→
   534→**Examples:**
   535→
   536→```liquid
   537→{% include summarize-page.html src=&quot;/7habits&quot; %}
   538→{% include summarize-page.html src=&quot;/death&quot; %}
   539→{% include summarize-page.html src=&quot;/gap-year&quot; %}
   540→```

Senior engineer at Meta. Dad of two. The guy who bikes everywhere and does magic tricks at parties. These aren&#x27;t lies - they&#x27;re real parts of who I am. But here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m learning: when I&#x27;m living entirely for that r\u00e9sum\u00e9, when I&#x27;m performing my identity instead of living it, something feels hollow.\n\nCarl Jung had a framework for this tension that I keep coming back to. He distinguished between the Ego (the social self we present to the world) and the Self (the totality of who we are, including the parts we hide or don&#x27;t know yet). The relationship between these two determines whether we&#x27;re living authentically or just playing a role.\n\nThis isn&#x27;t academic psychology for me. This is about the times I&#x27;ve chosen the impressive project over the meaningful one, the performative family moment over the genuine connection, the LinkedIn-worthy achievement over the thing that actually feeds my soul.\n\n&lt;!-- prettier-ignore-start --&gt;\n&lt;!-- vim-markdown-toc-start --&gt;\n\n- [What Ego and Self Actually Mean](#what-ego-and-self-actually-mean)\n  - [Ego: Your Social Operating System](#ego-your-social-operating-system)\n  - [Self: The Whole Truth](#self-the-whole-truth)\n- [The Four-Stage Cycle](#the-four-stage-cycle)\n  - [Stage 1: Ego Inflation - \&quot;I Am My Achievements\&quot;](#stage-1-ego-inflation---i-am-my-achievements)\n  - [Stage 2: Ego Deflation - When The Story Breaks](#stage-2-ego-deflation---when-the-story-breaks)\n  - [Stage 3: Dialogue with Self - Listening to What&#x27;s Been Ignored](#stage-3-dialogue-with-self---listening-to-whats-been-ignored)\n  - [Stage 4: Integration - Ego in Service of Self](#stage-4-integration---ego-in-service-of-self)\n- [How This Shows Up in Real Life](#how-this-shows-up-in-real-life)\n  - [Signs You&#x27;re Ego-Dominated](#signs-youre-ego-dominated)\n  - [Signs You&#x27;re Connecting with Self](#signs-youre-connecting-with-self)\n- [Practices for the Shift](#practices-for-the-shift)\n- [The Paradox: Ego Isn&#x27;t the Enemy](#the-paradox-ego-isnt-the-enemy)\n- [How This Connects to Everything Else](#how-this-connects-to-everything-else)\n\n&lt;!-- vim-markdown-toc-end --&gt;\n&lt;!-- prettier-ignore-end --&gt;\n\n## What Ego and Self Actually Mean\n\n### Ego: Your Social Operating System\n\nThe Ego is your conscious identity - the \&quot;I\&quot; that interacts with the world. It&#x27;s built from:\n\n- **Your roles**: parent, engineer, partner, friend\n- **Your achievements**: promotions, degrees, projects shipped\n- **Your reputation**: how others see you, what they expect\n- **Your self-image**: the story you tell about who you are\n\nThe Ego isn&#x27;t bad. It&#x27;s necessary. You need it to function in society, to hold down a job, to maintain relationships. Without an Ego, you&#x27;d be like a ship without a rudder - no direction, no ability to navigate social waters.\n\nBut here&#x27;s the trap: the Ego is designed to be loved, admired, and validated by others. When you over-identify with it, your whole sense of worth depends on external approval. You become the r\u00e9sum\u00e9, the LinkedIn profile, the performance.\n\nI see this in myself when I check how many likes a post got, when I angle for recognition in meetings, when I feel that little hit of validation from someone saying \&quot;You&#x27;re so productive!\&quot; The Ego loves that stuff. And there&#x27;s nothing wrong with enjoying it - until it becomes the only source of fuel.\n\n### Self: The Whole Truth\n\nThe Self is the totality of who you are - conscious and unconscious, light and shadow, socially acceptable and hidden away. It includes:\n\n- **The parts you show**: your public persona, your achievements\n- **The parts you hide**: your fears, your shame, your secret desires\n- **The parts you deny**: the anger you suppress, the grief you avoid\n- **The parts you don&#x27;t know yet**: your unlived potential, your unexamined gifts\n\nJung saw the Self as the organizing principle of the psyche - the deep, authentic center that knows your true path even when your conscious mind is confused. Some people call it intuition, inner wisdom, or the \&quot;still small voice.\&quot;\n\nThe Self doesn&#x27;t care about your LinkedIn profile. It cares about wholeness, authenticity, meaning. It&#x27;s the voice that whispers \&quot;This isn&#x27;t right\&quot; when you&#x27;re in the wrong job, even if it&#x27;s prestigious. It&#x27;s the pull toward creative work that doesn&#x27;t pay, toward the conversation that matters more than the networking opportunity.\n\nWhen I&#x27;m connected to my Self, I can feel it in my body. There&#x27;s a sense of alignment, of rightness, even when the choice doesn&#x27;t make external sense. Like when I chose to take [time off](/time-off) instead of chasing the next promotion, or when I decided to bike to work even though driving was more \&quot;efficient.\&quot;\n\n## The Four-Stage Cycle\n\nThe relationship between Ego and Self isn&#x27;t static - it&#x27;s a cycle you move through repeatedly at different levels throughout life. Understanding where you are in the cycle helps you know what you need.\n\n{% include quadrant-matrix.html\n    title=\&quot;The Ego-Self Cycle\&quot;\n    subtitle=\&quot;The journey from performance to authenticity\&quot;\n    x_label=\&quot;Self Connection \u2192\&quot;\n    y_label=\&quot;Ego Strength \u2192\&quot;\n    q1_name=\&quot;4.

You ARE your job, your role, your accomplishments. Your worth is tied to external markers of success.\n\n**What it feels like:**\n- \&quot;If I&#x27;m not producing, I&#x27;m not valuable\&quot;\n- Constant comparison to others\n- Can&#x27;t stop achieving, proving, performing\n- Terrified of failure or criticism\n- Exhausted but can&#x27;t slow down\n\n**Why it happens:**\nSociety rewards Ego inflation. You get promoted, praised, validated. The dopamine hits keep coming. So you keep feeding the Ego, building the r\u00e9sum\u00e9, collecting achievements.\n\n**My experience:**\nI spent years in this stage. My identity was \&quot;productive person who ships things.\&quot; I tracked everything, optimized everything, measured everything. I wrote about [treating life like a business](/life-as-business), which is peak Ego inflation - trying to systematize and control your way to worth.\n\nThe problem? It worked. Until it didn&#x27;t. The more I achieved, the more I needed to achieve to feel okay. The treadmill kept speeding up.\n\n### Stage 2: Ego Deflation - When The Story Breaks\n\nSomething punctures the Ego&#x27;s story. Could be burnout, failure, loss, or just a creeping sense that \&quot;this can&#x27;t be all there is.\&quot; The identity you&#x27;ve built starts feeling like a cage.\n\n**What it feels like:**\n- Depression, anxiety, or numbness\n- \&quot;What&#x27;s the point of any of this?\&quot;\n- Success feels hollow\n- Roles feel like prison\n- Nothing makes sense anymore\n\n**Common triggers:**\n- Mid-life crisis (classic for a reason)\n- Burnout from over-achievement\n- Major failure or rejection\n- Loss of a key role (job, relationship, health)\n- Simply running out of new achievements to chase\n\n**Why it&#x27;s necessary:**\nThe Self is knocking. All those parts you ignored while building your impressive life? They&#x27;re demanding attention. The Ego has to deflate so the Self can emerge.\n\n**My experience:**\nThis happens to me in smaller ways regularly - like realizing I&#x27;d stopped biking because it didn&#x27;t fit my \&quot;efficient Tesla driver\&quot; identity. Or noticing I was writing blog posts for the metrics instead of because I had something to say.\n\nThe bigger deflations came during career transitions, when the role I&#x27;d built my identity around suddenly didn&#x27;t fit anymore. That&#x27;s terrifying. Who am I if I&#x27;m not \&quot;that guy who does X\&quot;?\n\n### Stage 3: Dialogue with Self - Listening to What&#x27;s Been Ignored\n\nYou start turning inward. Listening to the parts of yourself that got exiled while you were busy performing. This is uncomfortable as hell because you meet your shadow - all the stuff you didn&#x27;t want to be.\n\n**What it looks like:**\n- Therapy, coaching, deep introspection\n- Creative work with no external goal\n- Time in nature, meditation, solitude\n- Journaling, dream work, active imagination\n- Facing uncomfortable truths about yourself\n\n**What you discover:**\n- The anger you&#x27;ve been suppressing\n- The grief you&#x27;ve been avoiding\n- The desires you deemed \&quot;unacceptable\&quot;\n- The gifts you&#x27;ve been too scared to claim\n- The truth about what you actually want\n\n**Why it&#x27;s generative:**\nThis is where real growth happens. Not growth as \&quot;more achievements\&quot; but growth as \&quot;more whole.\&quot; You reclaim the disowned parts. You integrate the shadow. You start distinguishing between what you actually want and what you think you should want.\n\n**My experience:**\nFor me, this looks like my [morning meditation](/siy) practice, where I actually sit with what I&#x27;m feeling instead of immediately problem-solving. It&#x27;s the [750 words](/750-words) journaling where I write without editing. It&#x27;s the conversations with my [AI life coach Tony](/bike-tesla-identity) where I work through contradictions instead of papering over them.\n\nIt&#x27;s also my [time off](/time-off), where I deliberately step away from achievement mode to remember who I am underneath the productivity.\n\n### Stage 4: Integration - Ego in Service of Self\n\nThis is the goal: your Ego becomes a tool in service of your Self rather than your master. You use your roles consciously rather than being controlled by them. You can achieve without over-identifying with achievement.\n\n**What it feels like:**\n- Choices feel aligned, even if unconventional\n- Less reactive to praise or criticism\n- Can hold paradoxes (successful AND authentic, driven AND peaceful)\n- Energy comes from within, not just external validation\n- Comfortable with uncertainty\n\n**What changes:**\n- You still have roles, but you&#x27;re not trapped by them\n- You still achieve, but it&#x27;s not compulsive\n- You still care what others think, but it doesn&#x27;t control you\n- You can be both ambitious and at peace\n\n**Why it&#x27;s not permanent:**\nThis isn&#x27;t a destination. You&#x27;ll cycle back through ego inflation and deflation at deeper levels. Each time through, you integrate more of yourself, become more whole. It&#x27;s a spiral, not a straight line.\n\n**My experience:**\nI taste this in moments: writing something because I need to say it, not because I think it&#x27;ll perform well. Choosing to [coach](/coaching) someone when there&#x27;s no career benefit. Taking the bike when the Tesla would be easier, because it feeds something in me that matters.\n\nIt&#x27;s also in how I think about [regrets](/regrets) now - not as failures of my Ego but as data about my values, signs from my Self about what matters.\n\n## How This Shows Up in Real Life\n\n### Signs You&#x27;re Ego-Dominated\n\n- **Compulsive achieving**: Can&#x27;t stop producing, shipping, proving\n- **Validation addiction**: Constantly checking metrics, likes, approval\n- **Identity crisis from role changes**: Who am I without this job/relationship/status?\n- **Exhaustion**: Performing your identity is tiring\n- **Comparison**: Constantly measuring yourself against others\n- **Can&#x27;t be alone**: Need external stimulation to feel okay\n- **Defensive**: Criticism feels like an attack on your existence\n- **Stuck in stories**: \&quot;I&#x27;m the kind of person who...\&quot; becomes a cage\n\n### Signs You&#x27;re Connecting with Self\n\n- **Aligned choices**: Decisions feel right even if they don&#x27;t make external sense\n- **Less reactive**: Praise and criticism are just data, not life-or-death\n- **Comfortable with paradox**: Can be both successful and searching, confident and uncertain\n- **Energy from within**: Not entirely dependent on external validation\n- **Okay with uncertainty**: Don&#x27;t need to have it all figured out\n- **Can be alone**: Solitude is generative, not threatening\n- **Open to growth**: Criticism can be useful information\n- **Flexible identity**: Can try on different roles without losing yourself\n\n## Practices for the Shift\n\nMoving from Ego-dominance to Self-alignment isn&#x27;t a one-time thing. It&#x27;s a daily practice. Here&#x27;s what helps me:\n\n**Solitude and reflection:**\n- Regular time alone without agenda or distraction\n- Morning meditation where I just sit with what is\n- Walks without podcasts or music\n- My [time off](/time-off) rituals of stepping away from achievement mode\n\n**Creative expression with no audience:**\n- Writing that never gets published\n- Magic practice just for the joy of it\n- Projects with no career benefit\n- Art that serves no purpose\n\n**Depth work:**\n- Therapy or [coaching](/coaching) that goes beyond problem-solving\n- Conversations that aren&#x27;t networking\n- Books that challenge your worldview\n- [Journaling](/750-words) without editing\n\n**Notice what you&#x27;re hiding:**\n- The anger you suppress\n- The desires you deem \&quot;unacceptable\&quot;\n- The parts of yourself you exile\n- The choices you make for image rather than truth\n\n**Body-based practices:**\n- [Mindfulness meditation](/siy) that keeps you present\n- Exercise that&#x27;s not about achievement\n- Notice how choices feel in your body\n- Pay attention to what gives you energy vs what drains you\n\n**Work with your shadow:**\n- Notice what triggers you in others (often disowned parts of yourself)\n- Explore the \&quot;unacceptable\&quot; feelings (rage, jealousy, pettiness)\n- Reclaim the gifts you&#x27;ve been too scared to claim\n- Ask: what parts of me have I exiled to maintain this identity?\n\n## The Paradox: Ego Isn&#x27;t the Enemy\n\nHere&#x27;s what I keep learning: the goal isn&#x27;t to destroy your Ego or transcend it. The goal is to right-size it.\n\nYou need an Ego to function. You need roles, identity, the ability to navigate social reality. The problem comes from over-identification - when you forget that the role is something you&#x27;re playing rather than who you are.\n\n**Healthy Ego:**\n- Knows it&#x27;s a tool, not the whole person\n- Serves the Self&#x27;s deeper purpose\n- Can adapt and change as needed\n- Doesn&#x27;t require constant validation\n- Can hold achievement lightly\n\n**Integration means:**\n- Let Self lead, Ego execute\n- Use social roles as vehicles for Self-expression, not prisons\n- Dance between individual authenticity and social connection\n- Be in the world but not entirely of it\n- Achieve without over-identifying with achievement\n\nI think about my [Tesla vs bike identity crisis](/bike-tesla-identity). My Ego wanted the story to be simple: \&quot;I&#x27;m a car-free person\&quot; or \&quot;I&#x27;m a Tesla driver.\&quot; But my Self knows it&#x27;s both/and. Sometimes the bike serves what I need (connection to the body, mindfulness, adventure). Sometimes the Tesla serves what I need (family time, long trips, creative space).\n\nThe Ego wants a consistent story. The Self is comfortable with complexity.\n\n## How This Connects to Everything Else\n\nThis framework ties together so many things I&#x27;ve been working on:\n\n**Mindfulness and emotional intelligence:**\n{% include summarize-page.html src=\&quot;/siy\&quot; %}\n\nThe body scan and self-awareness practices in Search Inside Yourself are literally practices for distinguishing Ego from Self. \&quot;I am angry\&quot; (Ego identification) vs \&quot;I feel anger in my body\&quot; (Self observation).\n\n**Understanding your shadows and triggers:**\nThose [regrets](/regrets) you carry? Often they&#x27;re your Self trying to tell you something your Ego doesn&#x27;t want to hear. The regrets point to your values - what your Self actually cares about versus what your Ego thinks you should want.\n\n**Life transitions and identity shifts:**\nMy [bike vs Tesla](/bike-tesla-identity) story is a microcosm of the Ego-Self dynamic. The Ego wanted a fixed identity. The Self knew I needed flexibility.\n\n**The coaching mindset:**\nWhen I&#x27;m [coaching](/coaching) someone, I&#x27;m often helping them distinguish between Ego concerns (status, image, should) and Self concerns (meaning, alignment, truth). The breakthrough moments come when they stop defending their Ego and start listening to their Self.\n\n**Time off and rest:**\nMy [time off](/time-off) is literally scheduled Ego deflation - stepping away from achievement mode so I can hear what my Self actually needs.\n\n---\n\nThis is a framework I&#x27;m still learning. I catch myself in Ego inflation regularly - chasing metrics, performing my identity, needing validation. But now I notice it faster. I can ask: \&quot;Is this serving my Ego or my Self?\&quot; And sometimes, I can choose differently.\n\nThe work isn&#x27;t to get it perfect. The work is to keep dancing between these two parts of yourself - the social self that navigates the world and the authentic self that knows your true path. When Ego serves Self instead of the other way around, that&#x27;s when life starts feeling right.\n&quot;

    20→Carl Jung had a framework for this tension that I keep coming back to. He distinguished between the Ego (the social self we present to the world) and the Self (the totality of who we are, including the parts we hide or don&#x27;t know yet). The relationship between these two determines whether we&#x27;re living authentically or just playing a role.

    16→I&#x27;ve spent most of my life building an impressive ego. Senior engineer at Meta. Dad of two. The guy who bikes everywhere and does magic tricks at parties. These aren&#x27;t lies - they&#x27;re real parts of who I am. But here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m learning: when I&#x27;m living entirely for that résumé, when I&#x27;m performing my identity instead of living it, something feels hollow.

    20→Carl Jung had a framework for this tension that I keep coming back to. He distinguished between the Ego (the social self we present to the world) and the Self (the totality of who we are, including the parts we hide or don&#x27;t know yet). The relationship between these two determines whether we&#x27;re living authentically or just playing a role.

    22→This isn&#x27;t academic psychology for me. This is about the times I&#x27;ve chosen the impressive project over the meaningful one, the performative family moment over the genuine connection, the LinkedIn-worthy achievement over the thing that actually feeds my soul.</pre>

   396→### Alert Boxes
   397→
   398→Use alert boxes to highlight important information, warnings, or construction notices:
   399→
   400→**Syntax:**
   401→
   402→```liquid
   403→{% include alert.html content=&quot;Your message here&quot; style=&quot;info&quot; %}
   404→{% include alert.html content=&quot;Warning or caution message&quot; style=&quot;warning&quot; %}
   405→{% include alert.html content=&quot;Work in progress notice&quot; style=&quot;danger&quot; %}
   406→```
   407→
   408→**Common use cases:**
   409→
   410→- Construction/work-in-progress notices
   411→- Important caveats or disclaimers
   412→- Cross-references to related content
   413→- Privilege acknowledgments
   414→
   415→**Example:**
   416→
   417→```liquid
   418→{% include alert.html content=&quot;🚧 Construction Zone 🚧 This post is in heavy progress! 🔨 Check back later for updates ⏳&quot; style=&quot;warning&quot; %}
   419→```
   420→
   421→### URL Redirects
   422→
   423→Set up redirects for shorter, memorable URLs using both `redirect_from` and `alias`:
   424→
   425→**Syntax:**
   426→
   427→```yaml
   428→redirect_from:
   429→  - /shortname
   430→  - /abbreviation
   431→alias:
   432→  - /shortname
   433→  - /abbreviation
   434→```
   435→
   436→**Example:**
   437→
   438→```yaml
   439→redirect_from:

   399→
   400→**Why this matters:**
   401→
   402→Jekyll automatically generates excerpts (post summaries/previews) for blog indexes, RSS feeds, and social media sharing. The excerpt is typically the first paragraph or first ~150 words of your post. If you place an alert box, image, or other include immediately after the front matter, the excerpt will be broken or empty, resulting in:
   403→
   404→- ❌ Broken previews in blog index pages
   405→- ❌ Empty descriptions for social media shares
   406→- ❌ Missing summaries in RSS feeds
   407→- ❌ Poor SEO snippet previews
   408→
   409→**What excerpts are:**
   410→
   411→Excerpts are automatically extracted text snippets that represent your post in:
   412→- Blog homepage listing pages
   413→- Category/tag archive pages
   414→- RSS/Atom feed readers
   415→- Social media link previews (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)
   416→- Search engine result snippets
   417→
   418→**Correct structure:**
   419→
   420→```markdown
   421→---
   422→title: &quot;Post Title&quot;
   423→permalink: /url
   424→---
   425→
   426→Your compelling opening paragraph goes here. This should hook the reader and give them a clear sense of what the post is about. It should be plain text without any Jekyll includes, HTML, or special formatting.

   442→
   443→Your opening paragraph...
   444→```
   445→
   446→**Best practices:**
   447→- Make the opening paragraph 2-4 sentences
   448→- Hook the reader with a personal stake or compelling question
   449→- Give enough context that the excerpt works as a standalone preview
   450→- Keep it conversational and engaging
