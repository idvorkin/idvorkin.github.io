I'll help you create a blog post about these ideal kid prompts from Amy Morin's thread. Let me first check if we have any existing content about parenting or kid prompts.

Let me help you create a blog post about ideal kid prompts, incorporating Amy Morin's thread and our existing content about parenting and family conversations. I'll first check if we have a good place to add this content.

---

_\*\*\*\*_

---

_\*\*\*\*_

I see we have a `_d/prompt.md` file that already contains some kid prompts. Let me read it to see how we can best integrate Amy Morin's prompts.

---

_\*\*\*\*_

Read file: \_d/prompt.md

---

_\*\*\*\*_

I'll now edit the prompts file to add Amy Morin's prompts and organize them into appropriate categories. I'll create a new section specifically for emotional intelligence and self-reflection prompts for kids.

_\*\*\*\*_

I've added two new sections to the Kids prompts:

1. "Emotional Intelligence & Growth" - These prompts help kids develop self-awareness, resilience, and emotional intelligence
2. "Family Connection" - These prompts help strengthen parent-child bonds and create meaningful conversations

The new sections incorporate Amy Morin's prompts and add some additional complementary ones. The prompts are organized to progress from lighter topics to deeper emotional connections, while maintaining an age-appropriate and engaging approach.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to the new sections or add any other categories of prompts?

"What made you laugh today?"
"What was the most interesting thing you learned today?"
"Who did you sit with at lunch?"
"What are you looking forward to tomorrow?"
"Is there anything you'd like to talk about?"

And for kids when they feel dissapointemnt:

Questions to Ask:
“What would you say to a friend who said that to themselves?”
“What’s another way you could approach this?”
“What’s the next step?”
Things to Tell Them:
“It’s okay to feel sad—it shows you care.”
“This didn’t go how I wanted, but I’ll figure out what to do next.”
“I’m proud of you for putting in so much effort, even though it didn’t work out this time.”

I've added the new "When Feeling Disappointed" section under Kids with both the questions to ask and supportive statements to share. I've also updated the table of contents to include the new section. Would you like me to make any adjustments to the formatting or organization?

I've converted the "When Feeling Disappointed" section into a single flat list, removing the categories and quotation marks. Would you like me to make any other adjustments to the formatting?

Summarize changes

_**Assistant**_

I've made the following changes to the prompts file:

1. Added a new "How Was Your Day" section with 10 specific questions to replace the generic "how was your day?":

   - What was the best part of your day?
   - Was there anything frustrating about your day?
   - Did you help anyone today?
   - Did anyone help you today?
   - What did you do at recess?
   - What made you laugh today?
   - What was the most interesting thing you learned today?
   - Who did you sit with at lunch?
   - What are you looking forward to tomorrow?
   - Is there anything you'd like to talk about?

2. Added a new "When Feeling Disappointed" section with 6 prompts as a flat list:

   - What would you say to a friend who said that to themselves?
   - What's another way you could approach this?
   - What's the next step?
   - It's okay to feel sad—it shows you care
   - This didn't go how I wanted, but I'll figure out what to do next
   - I'm proud of you for putting in so much effort, even though it didn't work out this time

3. Updated the table of contents to include both new sections under the Kids category.

Would you like any adjustments to these changes?
