## Enhancing Goals Post with Metrics (2/17/2025, 12:05:19 PM)

_**User**_

Add content on input vs output metrics to goals post

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add content about input vs output metrics to the goals post. First, let me search for the existing goals post.

---

_\*\*\*\*_

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "permalink: /goals" â€¢ **1** files</summary>
        
| File | Line | Match |
|------|------|-------|
| `file:///Users/idvorkin/gits/idvorkin.github.io/_d/goals.md` | L5 | `permalink: /goals` |

</details>

---

_\*\*\*\*_

Great, I found the goals post in the drafts folder. Let me read its current content to understand where best to add the new section about input vs output metrics.

---

_\*\*\*\*_

Read file: \_d/goals.md

---

_\*\*\*\*_

I see that there's already a section for "Input vs output metrics" in the table of contents, but it currently only has "asdf" as a placeholder. I'll add meaningful content about input vs output metrics in goals.

---

_\*\*\*\*_

```diff
  ## Input vs output metrics

- asdf
+ Input metrics measure the actions and efforts you put in, while output metrics measure the results you achieve. Both have their place in goal setting:
+
+ **Output Metrics**
+ - Measure the actual results and impact
+ - Examples: Revenue generated, customer satisfaction score, project completion
+ - Advantages:
+   - Directly tied to business value
+   - Clear indication of success
+ - Disadvantages:
+   - Often lag indicators
+   - May be influenced by factors outside your control
+   - Can encourage short-term thinking
+
+ **Input Metrics**
+ - Measure the activities and efforts that lead to results
+ - Examples: Sales calls made, features shipped, training hours completed
+ - Advantages:
+   - Leading indicators
+   - More directly controllable
+   - Help build good habits and systems
+ - Disadvantages:
+   - Don't guarantee results
+   - Can encourage "busy work" without impact
+
+ {% include alert.html content="The best goal systems often combine both input and output metrics. Use output metrics to define success, and input metrics to track progress and adjust course along the way." %}
+
+ For example, if your goal is to improve team productivity:
+ - Output metric: Number of features shipped per quarter
+ - Input metrics:
+   - Weekly planning sessions completed
+   - Code review turnaround time
+   - Technical debt cleanup hours
+
+ This combination ensures you're both doing the right activities (input) and achieving the desired results (output).

  ## Culture vs Strategy
```

---

_\*\*\*\*_

I've added comprehensive content about input vs output metrics to the goals post. The new section:

1. Defines both types of metrics
2. Provides clear examples of each
3. Lists advantages and disadvantages
4. Includes an alert box highlighting the importance of combining both types
5. Provides a concrete example in the context of team productivity

The content fits well with the existing structure of the post and maintains the professional yet accessible tone. Would you like me to make any adjustments to this content?

---

_**User**_

Add a note that lead and lag are synonyms

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll add a clarifying note about lead and lag indicators being synonymous with input and output metrics.

---

_\*\*\*\*_

```diff

  Input metrics measure the actions and efforts you put in, while output metrics measure the results you achieve. Both have their place in goal setting:
+
+ {% include alert.html content="Input metrics are also known as 'leading indicators' while output metrics are known as 'lagging indicators' - they mean the same thing." style="info" %}

  **Output Metrics**
```

---

_\*\*\*\*_

I've added an info alert box that clearly states the synonymous relationship between:

- Input metrics = Leading indicators
- Output metrics = Lagging indicators

The alert is placed right after the initial definition, before diving into the details of each type, which helps readers understand these common terms early in the section. Would you like any adjustments to this addition?

---

_**User**_

Merge the note into the first paragraph

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll merge the lead/lag indicator information into the opening paragraph and remove the alert box.

---

_\*\*\*\*_

```diff

```

---

_\*\*\*\*_

I've merged the information about lead/lag indicators into the opening paragraph in a concise way using parenthetical references. This maintains the flow of the text while providing the same information more efficiently. Would you like any adjustments to this change?

---

_**User**_

Maybe make a section like input/ouput, then Intent: Tteam Productivty and Intent: Losing Weight and Intent: Improving Partner relationships

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll reorganize the section to include multiple real-world examples of input/output metrics for different intents/goals.

---

_\*\*\*\*_

```diff
  {% include alert.html content="The best goal systems often combine both input and output metrics. Use output metrics to define success, and input metrics to track progress and adjust course along the way." %}

- For example, if your goal is to improve team productivity:
- - Output metric: Number of features shipped per quarter
+ ### Real-world Examples
+
+ **Intent: Team Productivity**
+ - Output metrics:
+   - Features shipped per quarter
+   - Customer-reported bugs
+   - System uptime
  - Input metrics:
    - Weekly planning sessions completed
    - Code review turnaround time
    - Technical debt cleanup hours

- This combination ensures you're both doing the right activities (input) and achieving the desired results (output).
+ **Intent: Weight Loss**
+ - Output metrics:
+   - Weight on scale
+   - Body fat percentage
+   - Waist measurement
+ - Input metrics:
+   - Daily calorie tracking completed
+   - Weekly meal prep sessions
+   - Exercise minutes per week
+   - Hours of sleep per night
+
+ **Intent: Improving Partner Relationships**
+ - Output metrics:
+   - Partner satisfaction score
+   - Number of conflicts per month
+   - Quality time spent together
+ - Input metrics:
+   - Weekly date nights completed
+   - Daily appreciation expressions
+   - Active listening practice sessions
+   - Shared activity participation
+
+ The key is matching your input metrics to activities that will drive your desired outputs. This combination ensures you're both doing the right activities (input) and achieving the desired results (output).

  ## Culture vs Strategy
```

---

_\*\*\*\*_

I've reorganized the section to include three detailed examples of input/output metrics for different goals:

1. Team Productivity (expanded from the original example)
2. Weight Loss (new example)
3. Improving Partner Relationships (new example)

Each example now includes multiple output and input metrics that are specific and measurable. I've kept the core explanation about input/output metrics at the beginning and the alert box about combining both types, but moved the examples into their own subsection with clear "Intent:" headers.

The new structure makes it easier to see how input/output metrics apply across different domains while maintaining the key message about the relationship between activities and results.

Would you like any adjustments to these examples or would you like to add any other intent/goal examples?

_**User**_

In why, add Al ink to 4dx

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll add a link to the 4DX (4 Disciplines of Execution) content in the "Why goals" section.

---

_\*\*\*\*_

```diff

  Answer what, why, and how do we know there.

+ For a deep dive into goal execution, see [4 Disciplines of Execution](/4dx).

  ### Goals vs Systems
```

---

_\*\*\*\*_

I've added a link to the 4DX content in the "Why goals" section, placing it between the introduction and the "Goals vs Systems" subsection. The link uses the standard markdown format and points to the `/4dx` permalink. Would you like any adjustments to this addition?

---

_**User**_

use summarize below it

_**Assistant**_

I'll add a summarize-page include for the 4DX content right after the link.

---

_\*\*\*\*_

I've added the `summarize-page.html` include for the 4DX content right after the link. This will pull in a summary of the 4DX page content, giving readers a preview of what they'll find if they follow the link. Would you like any adjustments to this addition?

---

_**User**_

Seems like we can re-work order of the ToC

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, I'll reorganize the Table of Contents to have a more logical flow. I'll group related concepts and move from theory to practice.

I've reorganized the table of contents to have a more logical flow:

1. Started with foundational concepts:

   - Why goals
   - Goals vs Systems
   - Mission, Vision, Tenants, Goals
   - What vs How

2. Moved metrics understanding earlier:

   - Input vs output metrics (moved up since it's fundamental to understanding goal measurement)

3. Implementation frameworks:

   - Goal systems (OKR vs SMART)
   - Measuring goals
   - Extrinsic vs Intrinsic Motivations

4. Potential problems and solutions:

   - Metrics Anti-Patterns
   - Wrong KPIs (made this a subsection of Anti-Patterns)

5. Organizational aspects:

   - Culture vs Strategy
   - Process and Power

6. Ended with personal application:
   - Personal Goals

I also made "Wrong KPIs" a subsection of "Metrics Anti-Patterns" since they're closely related.

Would you like any adjustments to this organization? We might also want to consider:

1. Renaming some sections for clarity
2. Adding more subsections where appropriate
3. Combining closely related sections

---

_**User**_

Consider re-ordering and re-doing heirrar.fhy based on content

_**Assistant**_

I'll propose a new organization that better reflects the content and creates a more logical hierarchy. Let me edit the table of contents and move the sections accordingly.

_\*\*\*\*_

I've reorganized the content into a more logical hierarchy with six main sections:

1. **Why goals**

   - Made Mission/Vision and What/How subsections of Why
   - Keeps foundational concepts together

2. **Goal Measurement**

   - Combined all measurement-related content
   - Input/Output metrics with examples
   - Measuring goals with motivation considerations

3. **Goal Systems**

   - Focused on frameworks (SMART and OKR)
   - Renamed OKR section to be more descriptive

4. **Common Pitfalls**

   - Combined anti-patterns and wrong KPIs
   - More actionable section name

5. **Organizational Context**

   - Grouped culture and process topics
   - Shows how goals work in practice

6. **Personal Goals**
   - Kept as final section for individual application

Key changes:

1. Reduced the number of top-level sections
2. Created clearer hierarchies
3. Grouped related concepts
4. Made section names more descriptive
5. Removed redundant "Philosophy" section
6. Added "Real-world Examples" as a proper subsection

Would you like any adjustments to this organization?

_**User**_

Move Personal Goals to Real World Examples, and rename that to just examples

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll move Personal Goals under Real-world Examples and rename it to just "Examples". I'll also update the table of contents accordingly.

2. Removed "Personal Goals" as a top-level section
3. Added "Personal Development" as a new example under Examples
4. Moved the Mortality Software content into the Examples section
5. Updated the table of contents to reflect these changes

The examples section now covers a full range from organizational (Team Productivity) to personal development goals, making it a more comprehensive set of examples. Would you like any adjustments to these changes?
