Does my physical helath post talk about new skils?

Based on the search results, I can see that your physical health post does discuss new skills in the context of physical health and fitness. Specifically, in your `physical-health.md` post, you reference the laws of new skills when discussing physiotherapy:

> Physio therapy is a great model for improvement. You go, they coach you, and then you have to do the work.
>
> Critical because Practice makes permanent. See
>
> {%include summarize-page.html src="/new-skills"}

This links to your `/new-skills` post which outlines three key laws about learning any new skill:

1. Law 1: You'll Suck Until You Don't
2. Law 2: Practice Makes Permanent
3. Law 3: Humans overestimate what can be done in a week, and underestimate what can be done in a year

The physical health post applies these principles specifically to physical fitness and injury recovery, emphasizing that proper practice and consistent effort over time are essential for developing physical health, just like any other skill.

So yes, your physical health post does incorporate the concept of new skills, particularly in how it frames physical health improvement as a skill that follows the same learning principles as other abilities. The connection is made explicitly through the reference to your new skills laws when discussing physiotherapy and rehabilitation.

Let me also open the new skills post you referenced to see how they connect.

_\*\*\*\*_

Read file: \_d/laws-of-new-skills.md

---

_\*\*\*\*_

Looking at both posts, I can see that your physical health post does incorporate principles from your laws of new skills, particularly in several areas:

1. In the "How should I start?" section, you apply Law 1 ("You'll Suck Until You Don't") by encouraging beginners to start small and acknowledging that taking the first step is huge.

2. The physiotherapy section references the importance of proper practice (Law 2: "Practice Makes Permanent"), emphasizing that you need to do the work correctly under guidance.

3. Your progression advice for exercise (starting easy and gradually increasing intensity by no more than 10% per week) reflects Law 3 about the importance of consistent practice over time rather than trying to do too much too quickly.

4. The kettlebell section shows your own progress over time, demonstrating Law 3 in action - you've progressed from lighter to heavier weights through consistent practice.

5. Your trainer section emphasizes the importance of proper form and guidance (Law 2) to ensure you're practicing correctly rather than reinforcing bad habits.

The connection between physical health and new skills is woven throughout the post, treating physical fitness as a skill that follows the same learning principles as any other new ability. Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of how these concepts connect?

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you open the physical health post in your browser. Since this is a Jekyll blog post, I'll use the permalink format to open it.

```bash
open http://localhost:4000/physical-health
```

```

Jump to the section including new skills

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you jump directly to the section that references new skills. From the content we reviewed earlier, this is in the physiotherapy section. I'll open the URL with the appropriate anchor:

---

_\*\*\*\*_

```bash
open "http://localhost:4000/physical-health#my-body-part-really-hurts-what-should-i-do"
```

```
❯ open "http://localhost:4000/physical-health#my-body-part-really-hurts-what-should-i-do"
```

---

_\*\*\*\*_

This will take you to the section where you discuss physiotherapy and its connection to the principles of new skills, particularly the concept that "Practice makes permanent" and the importance of proper guidance in learning new physical movements and recovery techniques.

---

_**User**_

When talking about new habits, include summary for new-skills and habit posts

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you edit the physical health post to include summaries of both the new-skills and habits posts in the section about starting new habits.

  ### Why? So you can look good in your jeans? So you can wrestle bears?

  I'd start with cardio exercise (e.g. endurance fitness). That will give you the most energy, which you'll require to bootstrap the other disciplines. After you've been doing that for a month or so, I'd tackle sleep and when that feels stable I'd add weight loss.

  But a few points to add after you read the article:
```

---

_\*\*\*\*_

I've added the summary includes for both `/new-skills` and `/habits` in the section where you discuss starting new habits. This will provide readers with important context about:

1. The laws of new skills (sucking until you don't, practice makes permanent, and the week/year estimation principle)
2. Your insights about habit formation

This addition strengthens the connection between physical health improvements and the fundamental principles of learning new skills and forming habits. Would you like me to make any adjustments to the placement or add any additional context around these summaries?

I'll help you jump directly to the section where I added the new skills and habits summaries in the "How should I start?" section:

This will take you to the section where I added the summaries of both the new-skills and habits posts, right after the part where you discuss taking the first steps in improving physical health.

_**User**_

Perfect, update the cursor to ask user if they want to open the blog at the right section when you edit a section

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand you want me to update my behavior to proactively offer to open the blog at the relevant section after making edits. Here's how I'll do that going forward:

1. After making an edit to a blog post, I'll:
   - Identify the relevant section anchor
   - Ask if you'd like to view the changes in the browser
   - If yes, use the `open http://localhost:4000/{permalink}#{anchor}` format

For example, after the edit I just made, I should have said something like:

"I've added the summaries for new-skills and habits to the 'How should I start?' section. Would you like me to open the blog to view these changes? I can open it directly to that section using:

```
http://localhost:4000/physical-health#how-should-i-start
```

Just let me know if you'd like me to open it."

Would you like me to add this behavior to the cursor rules to ensure it's followed consistently?

_\*\*\*\*_

---

_\*\*\*\*_

I'll create a new rule for this behavior:

````diff
     ```
  4. Opening full post when only modifying one section
- </example>
+ </example>
+
+ # Opening Blog Posts After Edits
+
+ ## Context
+ - After making edits to blog posts
+ - When sections or anchors are modified
+ - When content changes need to be verified
+
+ ## Requirements
+ - After editing a blog post section:
+   1. Identify the relevant section anchor
+   2. Ask user if they want to view changes in browser
+   3. If yes, use format: `http://localhost:4000/{permalink}#{anchor}`
+   4. Provide command to open directly to section
+
+ ## Examples
+
+ <example>
+ After adding content to the "How to Start" section:
+
+ "I've added the content to the 'How to Start' section. Would you like to view these changes? I can open it directly using:
+ ```
+ http://localhost:4000/physical-health#how-to-start
+ ```
+ Just let me know if you'd like me to open it."
+ </example>
+
+ <example type="invalid">
+ "I've made the changes. You can view them in your browser."
+
+ This is insufficient as it doesn't offer to open the specific section and requires manual navigation.
+ </example>

I've added a new section to the Jekyll development rules that specifies:

1. After making edits to a blog post section, I should:

   - Identify the relevant section anchor
   - Proactively offer to open the browser to that specific section
   - Provide the exact URL with the correct permalink and anchor
   - Wait for user confirmation before opening

2. I've included examples of both good and bad practices to make it clear how this should be implemented.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this rule? For example, we could:

1. Add more specific examples for different types of sections
2. Include guidance on handling multiple section edits
3. Add details about handling cases where anchors might not exist
