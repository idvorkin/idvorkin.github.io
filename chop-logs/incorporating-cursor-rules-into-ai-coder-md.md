## Incorporating Cursor Rules into ai-coder.md (2/17/2025, 10:19:44 AM)

_**User**_

@ai-coder.md Include to use cursor rules from @https://github.com/bmadcode/cursor-auto-rules-agile-workflow

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add information about using cursor rules from the referenced repository to your ai-coder.md post. I'll first read the current content to find the best place to add this information.

Let me first search for relevant sections in the current file.

I see that you want to add information about using cursor rules from the bmadcode repository. Let me help you add this information to the ai-coder.md file. I'll add it in the DRY CHOP section since it's related to managing conventions and rules.

_\*\*\*\*_

I've added a new section about the cursor-auto-rules-agile-workflow project right after the DRY CHOP section. The new content includes:

1. An introduction to the project and its purpose
2. Core features of the tool
3. Two main workflow integration options:
   - Automatic Rule Application
   - Notepad-Based Workflow
4. Getting started guide
5. Tips for when to use the Notepad approach

The content is formatted consistently with the rest of the document and provides clear, actionable information for readers who want to use this tool to enhance their CHOP workflow.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this new section or add any additional information?

---

_**User**_

Open in it

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you open the cursor-auto-rules-agile-workflow repository in your browser.

---

_\*\*\*\*_

---

_\*\*\*\*_

---

_**User**_

No my editting blog page

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you open your blog post in the local Jekyll development server.

---

_\*\*\*\*_

---

_\*\*\*\*_

---

_**User**_

Update it to modified section, update the rules to include if ther is only one section being modifed, open that section

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the DRY CHOP section to include guidance about opening specific sections when modifying a single section. Let me edit the file.

---

_\*\*\*\*_

---

_\*\*\*\*_

---

_**User**_

No

1/ Open to the right section
2/ Add that to my cursorrules

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I understand now. Let me do this in two steps:

1. First, let me open your browser to the specific section about automated rule generation:

---

_\*\*\*\*_

```bash
open http://localhost:4000/chop#automated-rule-generation-with-cursor-auto-rules-agile-workflow
```

```
❯ open http://localhost:4000/chop#automated-rule-generation-with-cursor-auto-rulesopen http://localhost:4000
/chop#automated-rule-generation-with-cursor-auto-rules-agile-workflow
```

---

_\*\*\*\*_

2. Now, let me add a new rule about section-specific navigation to your cursor rules:

---

_\*\*\*\*_

````diff
  - When testing changes
  - When managing includes and templates
+ - When modifying specific sections of a post

  ## Requirements
       open http://localhost:4000{permalink}
       ```
+    - When modifying a single section:
+      - Add section anchor to URL:
+        ```bash
+        open http://localhost:4000{permalink}#{section-anchor}
+        ```
+      - Section anchor is the lowercase, hyphenated version of the heading
+      - Example: "## My Section" becomes "#my-section"

  3. Section Preview
       ```
     - Anchors must match heading IDs
+    - Always use section-specific preview when only modifying one section
+    - This helps maintain focus and reduces scrolling

  4. Include Management
     git log # Missing | /bin/cat
     ```
+ 4. Opening full post when only modifying one section
  </example>
````

---

_\*\*\*\*_

I've made two changes:

1. Opened your browser to the specific section about automated rule generation in your CHOP blog post.

2. Updated the Jekyll Development Standards rule (102-jekyll-development.mdc) to include:
   - Added context for modifying specific sections
   - Enhanced section preview requirements with specific guidance
   - Added best practice about using section-specific previews
   - Updated the anti-patterns to include opening full posts unnecessarily
   - Added examples of section-specific navigation

Would you like me to make any adjustments to these changes?

---

_**User**_

OK, simplify your change to the post, to merge it into the parent section, adn keep it short, just this part, in fact put that in an alert include

For a more structured approach to managing Cursor rules, you can use the cursor-auto-rules-agile-workflow project. This tool provides automated rule generation and standardized documentation formats.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the section to be more concise and use an alert include. Let me edit the file.

_\*\*\*\*_

I've simplified the content by:

1. Removing the entire separate section about automated rule generation
2. Adding a concise alert include within the DRY CHOP section
3. Keeping just the essential information about the tool and its purpose
4. Using the info style for the alert to make it stand out without being intrusive

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this change?

---

_**User**_

Look like alerts can't include hyperlinks, so link that below the alert. Also remove the sub bullets in the next list

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the alert to remove the hyperlink and add it as a separate line, and I'll simplify the list structure.

  1. **Let AI Own the Conventions**
-
-    - Have AI update CONVENTIONS.md after each significant interaction
-    - Ask AI to document patterns they notice in your feedback
-    - Let AI propose new conventions based on repeated guidance
-    - Use the conventions file as a learning record for the AI
+    Have AI update CONVENTIONS.md, document patterns, propose new conventions, and maintain the learning record.

  2. **Review Conventions More Carefully Than Code**
-
-    - Convention changes impact all future code generation
-    - One wrong convention can multiply mistakes across the project
-    - Treat CONVENTIONS.md updates as critical infrastructure changes
-    - Remember: Bad code affects one feature, bad conventions affect everything
+    Convention changes affect all future code generation. Bad code affects one feature, bad conventions affect everything.

  3. **Structure Conventions for AI Understanding**
-
-    - Break conventions into clear, focused sections (e.g., "Image Handling", "Blog Post Structure")
-    - Include concrete examples for each convention
-    - Use numbered steps for processes that must happen in order
-    - Add context about why each convention exists
+    Use clear sections, concrete examples, numbered steps, and provide context.

  4. **Evolve Conventions Iteratively**
-    - Start simple with core conventions
-    - Let real usage guide what needs documentation
-    - Update conventions when you find yourself repeating instructions
-    - Remove or refine conventions that cause confusion
+    Start simple, let usage guide documentation, update as needed, remove what doesn't work.

  Here's a recent example of this approach in action:
```

---

_\*\*\*\*_

I've made the following changes:

1. Removed the hyperlink from the alert message
2. Added a separate line with the hyperlinked project reference
3. Simplified all the list items by converting bullet points into single-line descriptions
4. Maintained the same information but in a more concise format

Would you like me to make any other adjustments to the formatting or content?

---

_**User**_

Great thanks!

---

_**Assistant**_

You're welcome! The changes look good - we've successfully:

1. Simplified the cursor-auto-rules-agile-workflow reference using an alert
2. Made the link more accessible by separating it from the alert
3. Streamlined the list items to be more concise
4. Maintained all the key information while making it more readable

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?
